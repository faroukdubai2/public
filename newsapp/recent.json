The New START treaty, signed in 2010, limits the number of deployed nuclear warheads and delivery systems for both Russia and the United States. Its potential collapse would be a significant setback for global nuclear disarmament efforts and could further escalate tensions between the two superpowers."

While Oppenheimer is a strong contender for Best Picture, it faces competition in Best Adapted Screenplay from Barbie and American Fiction. Robert Downey Jr. is heavily favored for Best Supporting Actor. Barbie's lack of Best Director and Best Actress nominations has sparked discussions about reluctance to recognize female-directed projects with feminist themes. Lily Gladstone's Best Actress nomination for Killers of the Flower Moon could make her the first Native American to win an acting Oscar, but Emma Stone's performance in Poor Things remains a potential upset. Bradley Cooper's Maestro has garnered criticism, raising questions about why he has been targeted with schadenfreude. Billie Eilish is likely to win Best Original Song for \"What Was I Made For?\" from Barbie, putting her halfway towards an EGOT.

Top free agents include Kirk Cousins, Christian Wilkins, and Chase Young, while key defensive players such as L'Jarius Sneed and Justin Madubuike have been franchise-tagged. Running backs like Derrick Henry and Austin Ekeler will test the market's valuation of their position. Leading quarterback candidates include Cousins, Baker Mayfield, and Kirk Cousins, who is expected to command a significant contract despite an Achilles injury. The Patriots, Texans, and Giants are poised to be active in free agency, while the Chiefs, Cowboys, and Bills may need to prioritize retaining their own players. Potential free agent fits include Cousins to the Falcons,Danielle Hunter to the Rams, and Marquise Brown to the Titans. Edge rusher is the deepest position, and under-the-radar players to watch include Bryce Huff, Andre James, and Kendal Bourne. While Kirk Cousins' Achilles injury is a concern, other notable players with injury histories include Saquon Barkley, Tyron Smith, and DJ Reader. Draft implications may arise depending on where Cousins signs, while top free agents' landing spots could significantly impact fantasy football values."

These systems involve collective sensing, where multiple sensory organs work together to enhance the detection and localization of stimuli. Studies on electrosensory behavior in fish have shed light on neural mechanisms, evolution, and sensory processing in active-sensing animals. Moreover, electric field imaging by multiple electric discharges, similar to multistatic radar systems, has been observed in some fish species. The role of corollary discharge from electric organs and its integration with sensory inputs in facilitating perception and motor coordination has also been highlighted. Ongoing research continues to explore the complexities and capabilities of electric sensing in fish, providing insights into neural processing and the adaptation of sensory systems in diverse animal species.",

These animals employ active sensing for object detection, communication, and avoiding jamming. Neuroethological studies have investigated the sensory acquisition and integration processes involved in active sensing, examining the interplay between sensory input, neural processing, and motor output. Comparative analyses of different species have revealed variations in sensory processing strategies and the evolution of behaviors associated with active sensing. Furthermore, technological advancements in sensor networks and machine learning have facilitated the development of artificial systems that mimic active sensing capabilities, offering potential applications in surveillance, underwater navigation, and environmental monitoring."
