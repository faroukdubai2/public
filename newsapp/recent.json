                "newstext": "Washington CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Thursday will address Congress and the American people in what could be the most consequential speech of his presidency, seeking to boast about his first term while also warning the country about what he views as a ruinous threat to its very existence.\n\nWhile State of the Union addresses have typically been opportunities for presidents to present themselves at their most bridge-building and presidential, the primary results on Super Tuesday, which effectively consolidated the 2024 campaign into a two-man race, gives this year’s speech a political hue.\n\nWhile it remains to be seen how often Biden will invoke former President Donald Trump’s name – or whether he will choose to at all – the 2024 general election campaign, for all intents and purposes, will be kicked off with Biden’s speech.\n\nAs he delivers the address, Biden will command the attention of what might well be his largest crowd before November, giving voters concerned about his age and stamina a crucial barometer to determine whether the 81-year-old president is up for another four years in the job one month after a special counsel’s report faulted his memory and cognition.\n\nIt also gives Biden the opportunity to present his administration’s biggest wins directly to the American people, bypassing the traditional media, which Biden has frequently complained obfuscates his accomplishments and base of support.\n\nTouting his economic record, even if Americans aren’t perceiving a windfall\n\nThe United States economy has outperformed experts’ expectations since a year ago, when many economists thought it would be undergoing a recession right now.\n\nThat hasn’t happened for a variety of reasons. It’s not looking like it will anytime soon either with an unemployment rate that’s stayed below 4% for the past 24 months.\n\nBut Americans aren’t feeling so optimistic. In survey after survey, they’ve conveyed strong disapproval of the state of the economy, something Biden has struggled to wrap his head around.\n\nInflation is at the core of their consternation.\n\nEven though price increases have moderated significantly from two years ago, Americans are paying 18% for goods and services compared to before Biden took office, according to Consumer Price Index data.\n\nIt’s an issue Biden has acknowledged in the past and pledged to fix. His rhetoric on the economy has recently taken a more populist tone, with Biden saying in remarks earlier this year that “For all we’ve done to bring prices down, there are still too many corporations in America ripping people off.”\n\n“Price gouging, junk feeds, greedflation, shrinkflation,” Biden said in remarks in Columbia, South Carolina, adding the country is “tired of being played for suckers.”\n\nEven Cookie Monster has complained about feeling the pinch in his amorphous wallet.\n\nTwo days before Thursday’s address, Biden’s administration launched a new strike force with the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission “to root out and stop illegal corporate behavior” that results in higher prices for Americans.\n\nThis effort, aimed at demonstrating to Americans that he hasn’t lost sight of the impact high prices are having, will come up in Biden’s remarks Thursday, White House national economic adviser Lael Brainard told reporters on a call Monday night.\n\nThe Biden administration has also focused on lowering drug prices and health care costs more broadly, both through laws aimed at reducing costs and through administrative proposals aimed at increasing competition.\n\nFor instance, the administration proposed a rule in November governing the financial incentives that health insurers offering Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D drug plans can provide to brokers and agents.\n\nThe proposal would set up guardrails to prevent plans from providing excessive compensation to brokers and agents to steer potential enrollees to their policies rather than those in senior citizens’ best interests.\n\nFailed border deal and abortion rights provide a contrast with Trump\n\nFollowing the failure, at Trump’s urging, of a bipartisan deal that would have included significant border concessions from Biden, the president promised to make his case directly to the American people – blaming Trump directly for an issue that many Americans say is their top concern heading into November.\n\nBiden will have his largest platform yet to do so on Thursday.\n\nVisiting the US-Mexico border on the same day as Trump last week, Biden offered his foe an olive branch, entreating the former president to work with him to find a solution that would strengthen the United States’ southern border and overhaul its immigration system.\n\nTrump, who hopes to use illegal immigration as a political cudgel against Biden, has not accepted a truce.\n\nBiden has repeatedly cited Republican cowardice to stand up to Trump as the key reason why a deal failed. He’ll have a chance on Thursday to call out congressional Republicans directly.\n\nHe’ll also have the opportunity to elucidate his efforts to protect abortion rights in the United States, and the threat posed to those rights if Trump were to be elected again. The president and his administration have spent much of the time since the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court blaming Trump for the decision.\n\nDefending America’s role abroad\n\nSpeaking directly to the Republican-controlled House that dismantled hopes of the border deal that contained funding for Ukraine and Israel, Biden will have the chance to lay out in vivid detail the price of Republican waffling on additional support to the country in its third year of war against Russia.\n\nThe lack of further US-funded ammunition has had serious consequences for Ukrainian soldiers on the battlefield, and Biden has frequently said that history will judge harshly the lack of resolve shown in continuing to fund the country’s defense.\n\nThe speech comes weeks after Ukraine announced a withdrawal from the strategic hub of Avdiivka after fighting dealt heavy casualties to the Ukrainians, and as other world leaders doubt the future of American leadership abroad in a hypothetical second Trump term.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump - who has always been wary of leveling any sort of criticism at Russian President Vladimir Putin - has sharpened his rhetoric around withdrawing the United States from international partnerships, saying he would encourage Russia to attack US allies who don’t meet NATO spending guidelines and offering no criticism of Putin for the death of his leading critic, Alexey Navalny.\n\nPerhaps in an effort to drive Biden’s point home, the White House announced that Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, and Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska were both invited by the White House to watch Biden’s address. Neither were able to attend.\n\nBiden will also have the opportunity to defend his stance on Israel’s continued war in Gaza, as his continued, albeit increasingly tepid, support for the war threatens to turn a key progressive faction against him.\n\nWarning about democracy and threats at home\n\nBiden on Tuesday posted a picture on social media of himself reading the first page of his speech’s draft during preparations at Camp David.\n\nWhile that page contained the greetings customarily given by the president to the House speaker, members of Congress, the vice president and the American people, a close look reveals a name Biden hoped to invoke in his address, at least in its initial drafts.\n\nVisible semi-transparently through the first page is President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s name and the beginning of his 1941 speech to Congress, in which the nation’s 32nd president famously proposed four fundamental freedoms - freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear - and extolled the virtues of democracy across the world.\n\nOpening his address, Roosevelt told members of the 77th Congress that he was speaking to them “at a moment unprecedented in the history of the Union.”\n\n“I use the word ‘unprecedented,’ because at no previous time has American security been as seriously threatened from without as it is today,” Roosevelt said.\n\nBiden has made his own warnings - increasingly dire in recent months - about a threat to the US’ security. But that threat, the president has warned, comes from within.\n\nRoosevelt’s speech was given on January 6, 1941 - 80 years to the day before a mob incited by Trump stormed the building where Biden will address the country, in a violent attempt to disrupt the democratic process that put him in office.\n\nCNN’s Elisabeth Buchwald and Tami Luhby contributed to this report.",

His rhetoric on the economy has recently taken a more populist tone, with Biden saying in remarks earlier this year that “For all we’ve done to bring prices down, there are still too many corporations in America ripping people off.”\n\n“Price gouging, junk feeds, greedflation, shrinkflation,” Biden said in remarks in Columbia, South Carolina, adding the country is “tired of being played for suckers.”\n\nEven Cookie Monster has complained about feeling the pinch in his amorphous wallet.\n\nTwo days before Thursday’s address, Biden’s administration launched a new strike force with the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission “to root out and stop illegal corporate behavior” that results in higher prices for Americans.\n\nThis effort, aimed at demonstrating to Americans that he hasn’t lost sight of the impact high prices are having, will come up in Biden’s remarks Thursday, White House national economic adviser Lael Brainard told reporters on a call Monday night.\n\nThe Biden administration has also focused on lowering drug prices and health care costs more broadly, both through laws aimed at reducing costs and through administrative proposals aimed at increasing competition.\n\nFor instance, the administration proposed a rule in November governing the financial incentives that health insurers offering Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D drug plans can provide to brokers and agents.\n\nThe proposal would set up guardrails to prevent plans from providing excessive compensation to brokers and agents to steer potential enrollees to their policies rather than those in senior citizens’ best interests.\n\nFailed border deal and abortion rights provide a contrast with Trump\n\nFollowing the failure, at Trump’s urging, of a bipartisan deal that would have included significant border concessions from Biden, the president promised to make his case directly to the American people – blaming Trump directly for an issue that many Americans say is their top concern heading into November.\n\nBiden will have his largest platform yet to do so on Thursday.\n\nVisiting the US-Mexico border on the same day as Trump last week, Biden offered his foe an olive branch, entreating the former president to work with him to find a solution that would strengthen the United States’ southern border and overhaul its immigration system.\n\nTrump, who hopes to use illegal immigration as a political cudgel against Biden, has not accepted a truce.\n\nBiden has repeatedly cited Republican cowardice to stand up to Trump as the key reason why a deal failed. He’ll have a chance on Thursday to call out congressional Republicans directly.\n\nHe’ll also have the opportunity to elucidate his efforts to protect abortion rights in the United States, and the threat posed to those rights if Trump were to be elected again. The president and his administration have spent much of the time since the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court blaming Trump for the decision.\n\nDefending America’s role abroad\n\nSpeaking directly to the Republican-controlled House that dismantled hopes of the border deal that contained funding for Ukraine and Israel, Biden will have the chance to lay out in vivid detail the price of Republican waffling on additional support to the country in its third year of war against Russia.\n\nThe lack of further US-funded ammunition has had serious consequences for Ukrainian soldiers on the battlefield, and Biden has frequently said that history will judge harshly the lack of resolve shown in continuing to fund the country’s defense.\n\nThe speech comes weeks after Ukraine announced a withdrawal from the strategic hub of Avdiivka after fighting dealt heavy casualties to the Ukrainians, and as other world leaders doubt the future of American leadership abroad in a hypothetical second Trump term.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump - who has always been wary of leveling any sort of criticism at Russian President Vladimir Putin - has sharpened his rhetoric around withdrawing the United States from international partnerships, saying he would encourage Russia to attack US allies who don’t meet NATO spending guidelines and offering no criticism of Putin for the death of his leading critic, Alexey Navalny.\n\nPerhaps in an effort to drive Biden’s point home, the White House announced that Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, and Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska were both invited by the White House to watch Biden’s address. Neither were able to attend.\n\nBiden will also have the opportunity to defend his stance on Israel’s continued war in Gaza, as his continued, albeit increasingly tepid, support for the war threatens to turn a key progressive faction against him.\n\nWarning about democracy and threats at home\n\nBiden on Tuesday posted a picture on social media of himself reading the first page of his speech’s draft during preparations at Camp David.\n\nWhile that page contained the greetings customarily given by the president to the House speaker, members of Congress, the vice president and the American people, a close look reveals a name Biden hoped to invoke in his address, at least in its initial drafts.\n\nVisible semi-transparently through the first page is President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s name and the beginning of his 1941 speech to Congress, in which the nation’s 32nd president famously proposed four fundamental freedoms - freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear - and extolled the virtues of democracy across the world.\n\nOpening his address, Roosevelt told members of the 77th Congress that he was speaking to them “at a moment unprecedented in the history of the Union.”\n\n“I use the word ‘unprecedented,’ because at no previous time has American security been as seriously threatened from without as it is today,” Roosevelt said.\n\nBiden has made his own warnings - increasingly dire in recent months - about a threat to the US’ security. But that threat, the president has warned, comes from within.\n\nRoosevelt’s speech was given on January 6, 1941 - 80 years to the day before a mob incited by Trump stormed the building where Biden will address the country, in a violent attempt to disrupt the democratic process that put him in office.\n\nCNN’s Elisabeth Buchwald and Tami Luhby contributed to this report.",

                        "newstext": "WASHINGTON, D.C. – First Lady Jill Biden will welcome guests to join her in the viewing box for President Biden’s State of the Union Address on Thursday, March 7, 2024. Each of these individuals were invited by the White House because they personify issues or themes to be addressed by the President in his speech, or they embody the Biden-Harris Administration’s policies at work for the American people. The Second Gentleman, Mr. Douglas Emhoff, will also join the First Lady in the viewing box.\n\n\n\nThe following individuals, listed in alphabetical order, will be seated in the box with the First Lady and Second Gentleman:\n\n\n\nLatorya Beasley (Birmingham, Alabama)\n\nBeasley and her husband had their first child through in vitro fertilization (IVF) in 2022 and were in the process of expanding their family through another round of IVF when her embryo transfer was abruptly canceled as a result of the recent Alabama Supreme Court decision. Her recent experience is yet another example of how the overturning of Roe v. Wade has disrupted access to reproductive health care for women and families across the country.\n\n\n\nKris Blackley (Fort Mill, South Carolina)\n\nBlackley is an oncology nurse and the Director of Patient Navigation for the Atrium Health Levine Cancer Institute, part of Advocate Health. She has published research related to patient navigation showing improved outcomes, including decreased readmissions, increased treatment compliance, and equity in care. In 2023, the Biden Cancer Moonshot announced new actions to expand access to patient navigation services — services that help guide individuals, caregivers, and families through cancer screening, diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship. In February 2023, the First Lady visited Atrium Health, where Blackley shared how the health system plans to bring patient navigation services to more cancer patients and their loved ones as a result of the Biden-Harris Administration’s actions.\n\n\n\nJazmin Cazares (Uvalde, Texas)\n\nCazares is a leading advocate for gun violence prevention at the state and national level. After her sister Jackie was killed in the shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas, Cazares spent her senior year of high school traveling across the country and sharing Jackie’s story. She spoke alongside March for Our Lives leaders at the Texas State Capitol and testified before lawmakers to advocate for tighter background checks and extreme risk protection order laws. In 2023, Cazares was honored by the First Lady during the first-ever “Girls Leading Change” celebration at the White House.\n\n\n\nKate Cox (Dallas, Texas)\n\nCox is a mother of two from Texas who has experienced the devastating consequences of state abortion bans and courageously spoke out about her experience seeking the care she needed to preserve her health. Cox is one of the first women in 50 years to have to turn to the courts to ask permission to receive the abortion that her doctor recommended. She was ultimately forced to travel out of state for care that she would have been able to receive if the protections of Roe v. Wade were still in effect.\n\n\n\nSamantha Ervin-Upsher (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)\n\nErvin-Upsher is an apprentice with the United Brotherhood of Carpenters Local 432 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She is 23 years old and a mother of two. In 2023, Ervin-Upsher met the First Lady during a visit to Pennsylvania to highlight the Investing in America Workforce Hub in Pittsburgh, an initiative that seeks to build career pathways through high schools, community colleges, and unions to job opportunities fueled by President’s Biden’s investments.\n\n\n\nShawn Fain (Metro Detroit, Michigan)\n\nFain is a 29-year member and the current President of the United Auto Workers (UAW). Hailing from a family of UAW members, Fain got his start with UAW Local Union 1166 as an electrician for Chrysler at the Kokomo Casting Plant in his hometown of Kokomo, Indiana. In September 2023, President Biden joined Fain and UAW workers on the picket line in Belleville, Michigan, making history as the first sitting President to join a picket line. After hard-fought negotiations and a “Stand-Up” strike that inspired workers across the country, the UAW won historic pay increases, greater retirement security, more paid leave, and more dignity and respect. Their efforts also yielded job security commitments from General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis, including a commitment from Stellantis to bring thousands of good-paying UAW jobs back to Belvidere, Illinois. The UAW’s historic contract immediately led non-union automakers to announce double digit pay raises for their U.S. workers – adding further evidence that when unions do well, all workers do well.\n\n\n\nBettie Mae Fikes (Selma, Alabama)\n\nFikes is an American singer and civil rights advocate who was a Bloody Sunday Foot Soldier in Selma, Alabama in 1965. Known as “The Voice of Selma,” Fikes served as a member of Selma’s Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) Freedom Singers. She has performed at Carnegie Hall, Newport Jazz Festival, the Library of Congress, and was featured in the Smithsonian Institute’s Museum of Tolerance exhibition honoring women of the Civil Rights Movement. In 2023, Fikes joined President Biden to commemorate the 58th anniversary of Bloody Sunday in Selma, Alabama. This year’s State of the Union Address falls on the 59th anniversary of Bloody Sunday.\n\n\n\nSteven Hadfield (Matthews, North Carolina)\n\nHadfield has a rare blood cancer and is diabetic—two conditions that require very expensive drugs, including a drug that was selected for the first round of Medicare drug price negotiation. He held several part-time positions because he feared that, if he retired, he would not have sufficient income to pay for the drugs he needs to stay alive. The drug that treats his rare blood cancer costs about $15,000 a month. On top of that, his insulin costs him up to $400 every month. Now, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, Medicare covers his insulin prescriptions with a $35 copay cap per month. And for his blood cancer medications, this year, his Part D out-of-pocket drug costs are capped at about $3,500 and in 2025, he will benefit even more from the $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket drug costs.\n\n\n\nMayor Garnett L. Johnson (Augusta, Georgia)\n\nJohnson is the Mayor of the City of Augusta, Georgia. In 2023, Augusta was designated by the White House as one of five Investing in America Workforce Hubs, where President Biden’s agenda — including the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act — is driving historic investments and creating good-paying jobs. The Augusta Workforce Hub is led by a partnership between Mayor Johnson and three Augusta regional education institutions focused on training students in growing sectors, such as advanced manufacturing and construction skilled trades, to prepare the next generation for technical jobs in the region. The First Lady was last in Augusta in July and November 2023, to meet with Mayor Johnson and highlight how the local community is working together to expand pathways to careers.\n\n\n\nKeenan Jones (Plymouth, Minnesota)\n\nJones is a public middle school educator in Minnesota’s Twin Cities and a member of Education Minnesota. In April 2023, Jones wrote an email to President Biden to thank him for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which eliminated his remaining student loan debt after 10 years of public service and allowed him to continue his teaching career. Jones is one of the nearly 800,000 teachers, nurses, social workers, servicemembers, and other public servants who have received student loan debt forgiveness since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration.\n\n\n\nNatalie King (Detroit, Michigan)\n\nKing is the founder and CEO of Dunamis Charge, the first-ever African American women-owned electric vehicle charger manufacturing company in the United States. Her company employs over 135 workers and is on track to manufacture 400,000 electric vehicle chargers by 2025. In March 2023, King introduced President Biden at the Small Business Administration’s Women’s Business Summit, where she shared that the Administration’s investments in clean energy and small business owners helped her business thrive throughout the pandemic.\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Ulf Kristersson of Sweden\n\nKristersson is the Prime Minister of Sweden. Sweden is formally joining the NATO Alliance on March 7, 2024, becoming the 32nd Ally. Sweden is a strong democracy with a highly capable military that shares our values and vision for the world. Having Sweden as a NATO Ally will make the United States and our Allies even safer. NATO is the most powerful defensive alliance in the history of the world, and it is as critical today to ensuring the security of our citizens as it was 75 years ago when our Alliance was founded out of the wreckage of World War II.\n\n\n\nGovernor Stephen Roe Lewis (Gu-u-Ki, Sacaton, Arizona)\n\nLewis is serving in his fourth term as governor of the Gila River Indian Community. Under his leadership, he has prioritized bringing innovative solutions to long-term issues confronted by the Community and Indian Country. In partnership with the Biden-Harris Administration, Governor Lewis has revolutionized how Tribal governmental infrastructure is constructed, which led to the completion of the first new schools on the Reservation in over 100 years and the first solar-over-canal project in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n\n\nCommander Shelby Nikitin (Wakefield, Massachusetts)\n\nCommander Nikitin is an officer in the U.S. Navy and recently completed her command tour onboard the USS THOMAS HUDNER. Under her leadership, the ship deployed to protect maritime shipping from illegal, dangerous, and destabilizing Houthi attacks against vessels transiting the Red Sea. For her ship’s actions in this combat zone, Commander Nikitin was awarded the Bronze Star for her extraordinary leadership and bravery in defending lives and protecting the free flow of commerce in one of the world’s most critical waterways.\n\n\n\nJustin Phillips (Indianapolis, Indiana)\n\nPhillips is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Overdose Lifeline, a non-profit dedicated to reducing the stigma of substance use disorder and preventing deaths resulting from opioid and fentanyl overdose. Since starting Overdose Lifeline, Phillips has led the organization through program expansion to meet the growing needs of the population. Phillips worked to pass “Aaron’s Law” in Indiana and focuses her advocacy on expanding access to overdose prevention medications. Aaron’s Law allows individuals access to Narcan without a prescription, thus eliminating barriers to receiving the drug and using it to save lives. The Second Gentleman met Phillips and her daughter, Audrey, in 2023 at an event commemorating International Overdose Awareness Day, where the Administration announced additional federal funds to combat accidental overdoses. Phillips is a special guest of Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff.\n\n\n\nKameryn Pupunu (Lahaina, Hawaii)\n\nPupunu is a police officer for the county of Maui where he has served for the last five years. In August 2023, his hometown of Lahaina was engulfed in flames during one of the deadliest wildfires in U.S history. Pupunu was one of the many local police officers who performed heroic acts, including saving 15 individuals, from this deadly wildfire. Tragically, Pupunu lost four of his immediate family members to these fires.\n\n\n\nMaria Shriver (Los Angeles, California)\n\nShriver is an author, journalist, and founder of the Women’s Alzheimer’s Movement and Strategic Advisor on Women’s Health and Alzheimer’s at Cleveland Clinic. Shriver works to use her voice and platforms to advance some of our nation’s most pressing issues affecting women and women’s health. In November 2023, Shriver joined the President and the First Lady to announce the first-ever White House Initiative on Women’s Health Research, an effort led by Dr. Biden and the White House Gender Policy Council, to galvanize the federal government and the private and philanthropic sectors to spur innovation, unleash transformative investment to close research gaps, and improve women’s health. Shriver’s advocacy has been integral to the initiative and she continues to advise and collaborate with Dr. Biden.\n\n\n\nDawn Simms (Davis Junction, Illinois)\n\nSimms has been a member of the United Auto Workers (UAW) Local 1268 for more than two decades. She’s a third-generation autoworker on at Belvidere Assembly (IL), where she started work in 1999. When Stellantis idled Belvidere Assembly in February 2023, Simms’ son was in the middle of his sophomore year in high school and forced her into an impossible decision: lose her job or relocate to another plant far away from her home (and either move her son or leave him in Illinois). Thanks to the strength and the solidarity of the UAW members, the UAW-Big Three contract secured a commitment from Stellantis to reopen Belvidere Assembly and bring thousands of good-paying middle-class jobs back to Belvidere, stabilizing her family’s future. Today, she is gainfully employed at Stellantis’ auto distribution center in Belvidere. In November 2023, Simms joined President Biden in Belvidere to highlight the reopening of the assembly plant and the return of thousands of good-paying UAW jobs.\n\n\n\nRashawn Spivey (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)\n\nSpivey is the founder and owner of Hero Plumbing in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His decision to become a plumber was inspired by his mother, who worked for one of the first Black-owned plumbing businesses in Wisconsin. After graduating from a plumbing program at Milwaukee Area Technical College and completing an apprenticeship with Plumbers Local 75, support from his local union enabled Spivey to launch his own plumbing business. Spurred by investments from the Biden-Harris Administration, Spivey expanded his plumbing business to focus on lead pipe replacements. Spivey and his team have replaced more than 825 toxic lead pipes, primarily at local daycare centers, to ensure safer drinking water for his community and protect children from lead poisoning. Through historic levels of funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the American Rescue Plan, the Biden-Harris Administration is working to replace every lead pipe in America in the next decade.\n\n\n\nTiffany Zoeller (Fayetteville, North Carolina)\n\nZoeller is a military spouse and works as a medical coder at Fort Liberty’s Womack Army Medical Center. In June 2023, Zoeller introduced the President at Fort Liberty to announce the Presidential Executive Order on Advancing Economic Security for Military and Veteran Spouses, Military Caregivers, and Survivors. This Executive Order is the most comprehensive set of administrative actions any President has ever taken to support military spouses, and included nearly 20 new actions aimed at enhancing military spouse career stability, employment resources, and career transition assistance. The First Lady, through her Joining Forces initiative, has worked to eliminate barriers to employment and increase economic opportunity for military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors.\n\n###",

NATO is the most powerful defensive alliance in the history of the world, and it is as critical today to ensuring the security of our citizens as it was 75 years ago when our Alliance was founded out of the wreckage of World War II.<br>&#160;<br><strong>Governor Stephen Roe Lewis (Gu-u-Ki, Sacaton, Arizona)</strong><br>Lewis is serving in his fourth term as governor of the Gila River Indian Community. Under his leadership, he has prioritized bringing innovative solutions to long-term issues confronted by the Community and Indian Country. In partnership with the Biden-Harris Administration, Governor Lewis has revolutionized how Tribal governmental infrastructure is constructed, which led to the completion of the first new schools on the Reservation in over 100 years and the first solar-over-canal project in the Western Hemisphere.<br>&#160;<br><strong>Commander Shelby Nikitin (Wakefield, Massachusetts)</strong><br>Commander Nikitin is an officer in the U.S. Navy and recently completed her command tour onboard the USS THOMAS HUDNER. Under her leadership, the ship deployed to protect maritime shipping from illegal, dangerous, and destabilizing Houthi attacks against vessels transiting the Red Sea. For her ship&#8217;s actions in this combat zone, Commander Nikitin was awarded the Bronze Star for her extraordinary leadership and bravery in defending lives and protecting the free flow of commerce in one of the world&#8217;s most critical waterways.<br>&#160;<br><strong>Justin Phillips (Indianapolis, Indiana)</strong><br>Phillips is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Overdose Lifeline, a non-profit dedicated to reducing the stigma of substance use disorder and preventing deaths resulting from opioid and fentanyl overdose. Since starting Overdose Lifeline,&#160;Phillips&#160;has led the organization through program expansion to meet the growing needs of the population. Phillips&#160;worked to pass &#8220;Aaron&#8217;s Law&#8221; in Indiana and focuses her advocacy on expanding access to overdose prevention medications. Aaron&#8217;s Law allows individuals access to Narcan without a prescription, thus eliminating barriers to receiving the drug and using it to save lives. The Second Gentleman met Phillips and her daughter, Audrey, in 2023 at an event commemorating International Overdose Awareness Day, where the Administration announced additional federal funds to combat accidental overdoses.&#160;Phillips is a special guest of Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff.<br>&#160;<br><strong>Kameryn Pupunu (Lahaina, Hawaii)</strong><br>Pupunu is a police officer for the county of Maui where he has served for the last five years. In August 2023, his hometown of Lahaina was engulfed in flames during one&#160;of the deadliest wildfires in U.S history. Pupunu was one of the many local police&#160;officers&#160;who&#160;performed&#160;heroic acts, including saving&#160;15 individuals, from this deadly wildfire.&#160;Tragically, Pupunu lost four of his immediate family members&#160;to these fires.<br>&#160;<br><strong>Maria Shriver (Los Angeles, California)</strong><br>Shriver is an author, journalist, and founder of the Women&#8217;s Alzheimer&#8217;s Movement and Strategic Advisor on Women&#8217;s Health and Alzheimer&#8217;s at Cleveland Clinic. Shriver works to use her voice and platforms to advance some of our nation&#8217;s most pressing issues affecting women and women&#8217;s health. In November 2023, Shriver joined the President and the First Lady to announce the first-ever White House Initiative on Women&#8217;s Health Research, an effort led by Dr. Biden and the White House Gender Policy Council, to galvanize the federal government and the private and philanthropic sectors to spur innovation, unleash transformative investment to close research gaps, and improve women&#8217;s health. Shriver&#8217;s advocacy has been integral to the initiative and she continues to advise and collaborate with Dr. Biden.<br>&#160;<br><strong>Dawn Simms (Davis Junction, Illinois)</strong><br>Simms has been a member of the United Auto Workers (UAW) Local 1268 for more than two decades. She&#8217;s a third-generation autoworker on at Belvidere Assembly (IL), where she started work in 1999. When Stellantis idled Belvidere Assembly in February 2023, Simms&#8217; son was in the middle of his sophomore year in high school and forced her into an impossible decision: lose her job or relocate to another plant far away from her home (and either move her son or leave him in Illinois). Thanks to the strength and the solidarity of the UAW members, the UAW-Big Three contract secured a commitment from Stellantis to reopen Belvidere Assembly and bring thousands of good-paying middle-class jobs back to Belvidere, stabilizing her family&#8217;s future. Today, she is gainfully employed at Stellantis&#8217; auto distribution center in Belvidere. In November 2023, Simms joined President Biden in Belvidere to highlight the reopening of the assembly plant and the return of thousands of good-paying UAW jobs.<br>&#160;<br><strong>Rashawn Spivey (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)</strong><br>Spivey is the founder and owner of Hero Plumbing in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His decision to become a plumber was inspired by his mother, who worked for one of the first Black-owned plumbing businesses in Wisconsin. After graduating from a plumbing program at Milwaukee Area Technical College and completing an apprenticeship with Plumbers Local 75, support from his local union enabled Spivey to launch his own plumbing business. Spurred by investments from the Biden-Harris Administration, Spivey expanded his plumbing business to focus on lead pipe replacements. Spivey and his team have replaced more than 825 toxic lead pipes, primarily at local daycare centers, to ensure safer drinking water for his community and protect children from lead poisoning. Through historic levels of funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the American Rescue Plan, the Biden-Harris Administration is working to replace every lead pipe in America in the next decade.<br>&#160;<br><strong>Tiffany Zoeller (Fayetteville, North Carolina)</strong><br>Zoeller is a military spouse and works as a medical coder at Fort Liberty&#8217;s Womack Army Medical Center. In June 2023, Zoeller introduced the President at Fort Liberty to announce the Presidential Executive Order on Advancing Economic Security for Military and Veteran Spouses, Military Caregivers, and Survivors. This Executive Order is the most comprehensive set of administrative actions any President has ever taken to support military spouses, and included nearly 20 new actions aimed at enhancing military spouse career stability, employment resources, and career transition assistance. The First Lady, through her Joining Forces initiative, has worked to eliminate barriers to employment and increase economic opportunity for military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">###</p>\n\t\t\t</div>",

                        "newstext": "Sweden has officially became the 32nd member of Nato, in a landmark moment for the historically neutral country and the western military alliance.\n\nStockholm’s ratification process was finally completed in Washington on Thursday, as Sweden and Hungary – the last country to ratify Sweden’s membership – submitted the necessary documents after a drawn-out process that has taken nearly two years.\n\nFor Sweden, it marks the end of a 20-month-long wait that started in May 2022 when it submitted its application to join alongside Finland, prompted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February that year. Finland became Nato’s 31st member last year.\n\nRatification also marks a historic sea change in Sweden’s national and international identity, as it shifts away from the neutrality that started at the end of the cold war.\n\nThe ratification cements Nato’s control of the Nordic region, with all countries now members, and makes the Baltic an entirely “Nato sea”.\n\nThe process was completed at about 5.30pm Swedish time, when the Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, and the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, presided at a ceremony in which Sweden’s “instrument of accession” to the alliance was officially deposited at the state department. “Good things come to those who wait. No better example,” said Blinken.\n\nKristersson said Sweden was “coming home” to Nato.\n\n“Today is a truly historic day. Sweden is now a member of Nato. We are humble but we are also proud. Unity and solidarity will be a guiding light. Sweden is now leaving 200 years of neutrality and military nonalignment behind. it is a major step but a very natural step.”\n\nThe Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, was among the first to congratulate Sweden and said the Swedish flag would be raised outside Nato HQ in Brussels on Monday.\n\n“It’s official – Sweden is now the 32nd member of Nato, taking its rightful place at our table,” he wrote on social media. “Sweden’s accession makes Nato stronger, Sweden safer, and the whole alliance more secure.”\n\nSweden’s journey to Nato membership – which started under former prime minister Magdalena Andersson, of the Swedish Social Democrat party, and was taken over in 2022 by her successor, Kristersson, of the Moderate party – has been diplomatically fraught and long-winded.\n\nFirst, Turkey made multiple demands regarding Sweden’s stance towards members of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), which is deemed a terrorist group by Turkey, the US and the EU. Then, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and members of the US Congress had tied Turkey’s backing of Sweden’s Nato membership with congressional approval of the $20bn (£15.7bn) sale of Lockheed Martin aircraft and modernisation kits to Turkey.\n\nTurkey finally gave Sweden the green light in January, but Hungary continued to drag its feet, often giving obscure reasons. Some observers attributed the delay to Hungary’s nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who has close ties to Russia’s president Vladimir Putin. Others think it had more to do with Orbán’s desire to flaunt Hungary’s military and economic leverage, especially to a domestic audience. Hungary’s parliament finally voted “yes” at the end of last month.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to This is Europe Free weekly newsletter The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

                "newstext": "Montgomery, Alabama CNN —\n\nProviders in Alabama are resuming some in vitro fertilization services Thursday, the day after the state’s Republican governor signed a bill into law aimed at protecting IVF patients and providers from the legal liability imposed on them by a controversial state Supreme Court ruling.\n\nThe new law does not address the issue of personhood at the heart of last month’s unprecedented ruling, which prompted some providers to halt some IVF services, and experts say it’s going to take more work to fully protect fertility services in the state.\n\nThe Alabama Supreme Court ruled last month that frozen embryos are human beings and those who destroy them can be held liable for wrongful death. Three of the state’s limited pool of IVF providers immediately paused services, sending some families out of state to access treatment and prompting a widespread and urgent demand for lawmakers to provide a fast fix.\n\nThe new legislation, which passed in the majority Republican Alabama House and Senate late Wednesday before Gov. Kay Ivey signed it into law, aims to provide civil and criminal immunity to providers and patients for the destruction or damage to embryos. The legislation will apply retroactively.\n\nUnder the new law, “manufacturers of goods used to facilitate the in vitro process” or the “transport of stored embryos” also are provided with criminal immunity.\n\nWhile two of the three providers who halted IVF services are resuming those treatments, the third – the clinic at the center of the state Supreme Court case – told CNN the new legislation falls short of providing the legal protection it needs to resume care.\n\nGabbie Price, who uprooted her life and career in order to afford IVF, told CNN on Thursday she was relieved the new legislation passed, but called the law a “Band-Aid.”\n\n“I do feel like there’s a lot that needs to be addressed still – and I think a lot of other people feel that way as well – but with IVF being such a time-sensitive procedure, there are so many families that can’t wait,” Price said. “We had to get something in place for those families that could not wait.”\n\nStill, the law “does not nullify the Supreme Court’s analysis that says the law ought to treat embryos just like people,” Katherine Kraschel, an assistant professor at Northeastern University School of Law, told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nExperts have expressed concern that while the Republican-backed legislation protects providers from liability when it comes to the destruction of embryos, it could also insulate them from standard medical malpractice claims.\n\nThe Alabama House Democratic Caucus said the new legislation is “short-sighted and does not adequately address the many legal questions of embryonic personhood, nor the serious consequences of the unprecedented and dangerous Alabama Supreme Court ruling.”\n\n“Simply put, this legislation is not a solution,” its statement read. “It serves only to avoid a reckoning, at the cost of extending the complications of the Alabama Supreme Court’s ruling.”\n\nState Sen. Larry Stutts, a Republican and the lone lawmaker who voted against the measure in the state Senate, criticized the language in the bill, arguing it is “not an IVF protection bill, it’s an IVF provider and supplier protection bill” that is “limiting the ability of the mothers that are involved in IVF to have recourse.”\n\nUS Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat who proposed a national IVF protection bill that was blocked last week, was also critical of the new law.\n\n“I’m disappointed that Republican state legislators in Alabama refused to work in a bipartisan way to pass a real solution to this Republican-created crisis that makes it clear: an embryo is not a human being,” Duckworth told CNN in a statement Thursday.\n\nAlabama state Rep. Terri Collins and Sen. Tim Melson, Republicans who introduced the state legislation, have noted it was intended to provide immediate relief for families who have lost access to IVF services, while officials consider more permanent solutions.\n\n“This addresses the imminent problem and that is what I am trying to do today. Do we need to have the longer decision? Yes, we do,” Collins said last week.\n\n“This is the temporary fix,” Melson said last week. “This gets the ladies now currently in the situation, that are in limbo, back in the clinic.”\n\nIvey similarly acknowledged the new law was a quick fix after the court ruling and noted “there will be more work to come” on IVF protections.\n\n“I am pleased to sign this important, short-term measure into law so that couples in Alabama hoping and praying to be parents can grow their families through IVF,” Ivey said in a statement late Wednesday. “IVF is a complex issue, no doubt, and I anticipate there will be more work to come, but right now, I am confident that this legislation will provide the assurances our IVF clinics need and will lead them to resume services immediately.”\n\nIVF patients express cautious relief\n\nPrice cited concerns that the broad immunity meant to protect providers from liability could leave patients without regulations needed to keep them safe from possible medical malpractice.\n\n“It does make me a little nervous, and it does make me wonder if it’s going to be harder for those people fighting for those regulations to get them,” she said.\n\nElizabeth Goldman felt like she’d been living in limbo as her IVF treatments were halted. The uterus transplant recipient, who sold her home and moved to Birmingham to start a family, said she was “thankful” to lawmakers for coming together quickly and helping clinics reopen.\n\n“This has been an extremely stressful and scary 2 1/2 weeks waiting in limbo while my IVF clinic has been shut down,” Goldman told CNN, saying she’d watched every step of the legislation’s passing and now feels hopeful her “journey can continue after my clinic reopens.”\n\nGabrielle Goidel invested more than $20,000 into IVF treatment in Alabama, before her clinic halted IVF services and she and her husband had to leave the state to continue treatment. She said news of the new legislation left her and her husband in tears.\n\n“Although it doesn’t take away from all the hurt and craziness we felt, it feels like we are finally seeing change and feel supported,” Goidel said. “I feel immense relief and hope.”\n\nWhen will services start up again?\n\nOne of the clinics that halted IVF treatment after the state court’s decision, Alabama Fertility, in Birmingham, planned to resume services Thursday.\n\nThe clinic canceled at least 35 frozen embryo transfers – in which a fertilized egg is implanted into a uterus – in less than two weeks after pausing treatments. The practice already has an embryo transfer slated for Thursday afternoon, according to Mamie McLean, a doctor with the clinic.\n\n“We cannot wait to celebrate with our patients. Honestly, we can’t wait to do the first embryo transfer, we can’t wait to see the first positive pregnancy test … it holds even more meaning than it did before,” McLean told CNN before Ivey signed the new legislation.\n\nMcLean joined families and other IVF advocates at the Alabama State House last week to call for an immediate restoration of services, as lawmakers inside rushed to push through legislation that would protect them.\n\n“We appreciate the efforts from the legislators to push through a bill that meets the needs of all of the stakeholders involved in IVF treatments in Alabama,” said McLean. “We are grateful that they have heard our voices. We are proud of our patients who have bravely shared their stories and are so impressed with the advocacy efforts on behalf of infertility patients.”\n\nThe state’s largest health care system, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, also announced it would restart IVF services that were paused after the state Supreme Court decision.\n\n“UAB appreciates the Alabama legislature and Governor Ivey for swiftly passing and signing legislation that provides some protections and will therefore allow UAB to restart in vitro fertilization treatments, also known as IVF,” Dr. Warner Huh, chair of the UAB Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, said in a video statement. “While UAB is moving to promptly resume IVF treatments, we’ll continue to assess developments and advocate for protections for IVF patients and our providers.”\n\nThe defendants in the state Supreme Court case, The Center for Reproductive Medicine at Mobile Infirmary, will not yet be resuming IVF services, according to a statement from the clinic.\n\n“As we understand the language of the proposed law, as it stands, we are not reopening our IVF facility until we have legal clarification on the extent of immunity provided by the new Alabama law,” the statement said. “At this time, we believe the law falls short of addressing the fertilized eggs currently stored across the state and leaves challenges for physicians and fertility clinics trying to help deserving families have children of their own.”\n\nThe American Society for Reproductive Medicine released a statement last week warning that without legislation to address the issue of whether a fertilized egg is legally considered a person, IVF providers are still vulnerable.\n\n“We believe these bills will not provide the assurances Alabama’s fertility physicians need to be confident they can continue to provide the best standard of care to their patients without putting themselves, their colleagues, and their patients at legal risk,” the statement read.\n\nThe case at the heart of the ruling\n\nThe Alabama Supreme Court ruling stems from two lawsuits filed by three sets of parents who underwent IVF procedures to have babies and then opted to have the remaining embryos frozen.\n\nThe parents allege that several frozen embryos were dropped on the floor and destroyed in 2020 at an Alabama fertility clinic and sued the clinic. A trial court initially dismissed the claims, but the state Supreme Court ruling reversed that decision.\n\nA fourth lawsuit has since been filed against the defendants in the case.\n\nThough the new legislation applies retroactively, it likely won’t impact the case, as the Alabama Constitution holds that new legislation cannot be applied to active cases.\n\nGroups representing defendants in the lawsuits that culminated in the Supreme Court ruling that frozen embryos are children have filed an application asking the court to rehear the case, according to online records from the Alabama appellate courts.\n\nThe group is asking the court to reconsider their ruling, though the justices could take more than six weeks before deciding whether to grant the application to rehear the case, an Alabama court source told CNN.\n\nSome legal experts are skeptical that the court will agree to rehear the case.\n\nEven with some clinics planning to resume services, the court’s decision may still have an impact on Alabama families going forward, Kraschel said.\n\n“Courts, especially in Alabama, could cite the Alabama Supreme Court decision to treat embryos as people in other areas of the law as well,” she said.\n\nCNN’s Alta Spells and Shawn Nottingham contributed to this report.",

                        "newstext": "Montgomery, Alabama CNN —\n\nProviders in Alabama are resuming some in vitro fertilization services Thursday, the day after the state’s Republican governor signed a bill into law aimed at protecting IVF patients and providers from the legal liability imposed on them by a controversial state Supreme Court ruling.\n\nThe new law does not address the issue of personhood at the heart of last month’s unprecedented ruling, which prompted some providers to halt some IVF services, and experts say it’s going to take more work to fully protect fertility services in the state.\n\nThe Alabama Supreme Court ruled last month that frozen embryos are human beings and those who destroy them can be held liable for wrongful death. Three of the state’s limited pool of IVF providers immediately paused services, sending some families out of state to access treatment and prompting a widespread and urgent demand for lawmakers to provide a fast fix.\n\nThe new legislation, which passed in the majority Republican Alabama House and Senate late Wednesday before Gov. Kay Ivey signed it into law, aims to provide civil and criminal immunity to providers and patients for the destruction or damage to embryos. The legislation will apply retroactively.\n\nUnder the new law, “manufacturers of goods used to facilitate the in vitro process” or the “transport of stored embryos” also are provided with criminal immunity.\n\nWhile two of the three providers who halted IVF services are resuming those treatments, the third – the clinic at the center of the state Supreme Court case – told CNN the new legislation falls short of providing the legal protection it needs to resume care.\n\nGabbie Price, who uprooted her life and career in order to afford IVF, told CNN on Thursday she was relieved the new legislation passed, but called the law a “Band-Aid.”\n\n“I do feel like there’s a lot that needs to be addressed still – and I think a lot of other people feel that way as well – but with IVF being such a time-sensitive procedure, there are so many families that can’t wait,” Price said. “We had to get something in place for those families that could not wait.”\n\nStill, the law “does not nullify the Supreme Court’s analysis that says the law ought to treat embryos just like people,” Katherine Kraschel, an assistant professor at Northeastern University School of Law, told CNN on Tuesday.\n\nExperts have expressed concern that while the Republican-backed legislation protects providers from liability when it comes to the destruction of embryos, it could also insulate them from standard medical malpractice claims.\n\nThe Alabama House Democratic Caucus said the new legislation is “short-sighted and does not adequately address the many legal questions of embryonic personhood, nor the serious consequences of the unprecedented and dangerous Alabama Supreme Court ruling.”\n\n“Simply put, this legislation is not a solution,” its statement read. “It serves only to avoid a reckoning, at the cost of extending the complications of the Alabama Supreme Court’s ruling.”\n\nState Sen. Larry Stutts, a Republican and the lone lawmaker who voted against the measure in the state Senate, criticized the language in the bill, arguing it is “not an IVF protection bill, it’s an IVF provider and supplier protection bill” that is “limiting the ability of the mothers that are involved in IVF to have recourse.”\n\nUS Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat who proposed a national IVF protection bill that was blocked last week, was also critical of the new law.\n\n“I’m disappointed that Republican state legislators in Alabama refused to work in a bipartisan way to pass a real solution to this Republican-created crisis that makes it clear: an embryo is not a human being,” Duckworth told CNN in a statement Thursday.\n\nAlabama state Rep. Terri Collins and Sen. Tim Melson, Republicans who introduced the state legislation, have noted it was intended to provide immediate relief for families who have lost access to IVF services, while officials consider more permanent solutions.\n\n“This addresses the imminent problem and that is what I am trying to do today. Do we need to have the longer decision? Yes, we do,” Collins said last week.\n\n“This is the temporary fix,” Melson said last week. “This gets the ladies now currently in the situation, that are in limbo, back in the clinic.”\n\nIvey similarly acknowledged the new law was a quick fix after the court ruling and noted “there will be more work to come” on IVF protections.\n\n“I am pleased to sign this important, short-term measure into law so that couples in Alabama hoping and praying to be parents can grow their families through IVF,” Ivey said in a statement late Wednesday. “IVF is a complex issue, no doubt, and I anticipate there will be more work to come, but right now, I am confident that this legislation will provide the assurances our IVF clinics need and will lead them to resume services immediately.”\n\nIVF patients express cautious relief\n\nPrice cited concerns that the broad immunity meant to protect providers from liability could leave patients without regulations needed to keep them safe from possible medical malpractice.\n\n“It does make me a little nervous, and it does make me wonder if it’s going to be harder for those people fighting for those regulations to get them,” she said.\n\nElizabeth Goldman felt like she’d been living in limbo as her IVF treatments were halted.

She said news of the new legislation left her and her husband in tears.\n\n“Although it doesn’t take away from all the hurt and craziness we felt, it feels like we are finally seeing change and feel supported,” Goidel said. “I feel immense relief and hope.”\n\nWhen will services start up again?\n\nOne of the clinics that halted IVF treatment after the state court’s decision, Alabama Fertility, in Birmingham, planned to resume services Thursday.\n\nThe clinic canceled at least 35 frozen embryo transfers – in which a fertilized egg is implanted into a uterus – in less than two weeks after pausing treatments.

A trial court initially dismissed the claims, but the state Supreme Court ruling reversed that decision.\n\nA fourth lawsuit has since been filed against the defendants in the case.\n\nThough the new legislation applies retroactively, it likely won’t impact the case, as the Alabama Constitution holds that new legislation cannot be applied to active cases.\n\nGroups representing defendants in the lawsuits that culminated in the Supreme Court ruling that frozen embryos are children have filed an application asking the court to rehear the case, according to online records from the Alabama appellate courts.\n\nThe group is asking the court to reconsider their ruling, though the justices could take more than six weeks before deciding whether to grant the application to rehear the case, an Alabama court source told CNN.\n\nSome legal experts are skeptical that the court will agree to rehear the case.\n\nEven with some clinics planning to resume services, the court’s decision may still have an impact on Alabama families going forward, Kraschel said.\n\n“Courts, especially in Alabama, could cite the Alabama Supreme Court decision to treat embryos as people in other areas of the law as well,” she said.\n\nCNN’s Alta Spells and Shawn Nottingham contributed to this report.",

Three of the state&#8217;s limited pool of IVF providers immediately paused services, sending some families <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/22/us/alabama-embryos-ruling-ivf-treatment-leaving-state/index.html\">out of state</a> to access treatment and prompting a widespread and urgent demand for lawmakers to provide a fast fix.\n    </p>\n\n  <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder\">\n            The new legislation, which passed in the majority Republican Alabama House and Senate late Wednesday before Gov. Kay Ivey&#160;signed it into law, aims to provide civil and criminal immunity to providers and patients for the destruction or damage to embryos. The legislation will apply retroactively.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder\">\n            <strong> </strong>Under the&#160;<a href=\"https://legiscan.com/AL/text/SB159/id/2952994\" target=\"_blank\">new law</a>,&#160;&#8220;manufacturers of goods used to facilitate the in vitro process&#8221; or the &#8220;transport of stored embryos&#8221; also are provided with&#160;criminal immunity.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder\">\n            While two of the three providers who halted IVF services are resuming those treatments, the third &#8211; the clinic at the center of the state Supreme Court case &#8211; told CNN the new legislation falls short of providing the legal protection it needs to resume care.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder\">\n            Gabbie Price, who <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/29/us/ivf-alabama-supreme-court-ruling-treatment-pause/index.html\">uprooted her life and career in order to afford IVF</a>, told CNN on Thursday she was relieved the new legislation passed, but called the law a &#8220;Band-Aid.&#8221;\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder\">\n            &#8220;I do feel like there&#8217;s a lot that needs to be addressed still &#8211; and I think a lot of other people feel that way as well &#8211; but with IVF being such a time-sensitive procedure, there are so many families that can&#8217;t wait,&#8221; Price said. &#8220;We had to get something in place for those families that could not wait.&#8221;\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder\">\n            Still, the law &#8220;does not nullify the Supreme Court&#8217;s analysis that says the law ought to treat embryos just like people,&#8221; Katherine Kraschel, an assistant professor at Northeastern University School of Law, told CNN on Tuesday.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder\">\n            Experts have expressed concern that while the Republican-backed legislation protects providers from liability when it comes to the destruction of embryos, it could also insulate them from standard medical malpractice claims.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder\">\n            The Alabama House Democratic Caucus&#160;said the new legislation is &#8220;short-sighted and does not adequately address the many legal questions of embryonic personhood, nor the serious consequences of the unprecedented and dangerous Alabama Supreme Court ruling.&#8221;\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder\">\n            &#8220;Simply put, this legislation is not a solution,&#8221; its statement read. &#8220;It serves only to avoid a reckoning, at the cost of extending the complications of the Alabama Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling.&#8221;\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder\">\n            State Sen.

Terri Collins and Sen. Tim Melson, Republicans who introduced the state legislation, have noted it was intended to provide immediate relief for families who have lost access to IVF services, while officials consider more permanent solutions.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder\">\n            &#8220;This addresses the imminent problem and that is what I am trying to do today. Do we need to have the longer decision? Yes, we do,&#8221; Collins said last week.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder\">\n            &#8220;This is the&#160;temporary&#160;fix,&#8221;&#160;Melson said last week. &#8220;This gets the ladies now currently in the situation, that are in limbo, back in the clinic.&#8221;\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder\">\n            Ivey similarly acknowledged the new law was a quick fix after the court ruling and noted &#8220;there will be more work to come&#8221; on IVF protections.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder\">\n            &#8220;I am pleased to sign this important, short-term measure into law so that couples in Alabama hoping and praying to be parents can grow their families through IVF,&#8221; Ivey said in a statement late Wednesday. &#8220;IVF is a complex issue, no doubt, and I anticipate there will be more work to come, but right now, I am confident that this legislation will provide the assurances our IVF clinics need and will lead them to resume services immediately.&#8221;\n    </p>\n\n  <h2 class=\"subheader\" id=\"ivf-patients-express-cautious-relief\">\n    IVF patients express cautious relief\n</h2>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder\">\n            Price cited concerns that the broad immunity meant to protect providers from liability could leave patients without regulations needed to keep them safe from possible medical malpractice.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder\">\n            &#8220;It does make me a little nervous, and it does make me wonder if it&#8217;s going to be harder for those people fighting for those regulations to get them,&#8221; she said.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder\">\n            Elizabeth Goldman felt like she&#8217;d been <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/01/health/uterus-transplant-ivf-alabama/index.html\">living in limbo as her IVF treatments were halted</a>.

The new legislation was prompted by a state Supreme Court ruling that classified frozen embryos as legal persons, halting some IVF services. However, the ruling's implications on embryo personhood remain unresolved, and the Alabama House Democratic Caucus and Senator Larry Stutts criticized the new law's broad immunity, which they fear could limit patient recourse and leave providers vulnerable to medical malpractice claims. While the legislation aims to address concerns about liability and provide immediate relief, further legal protections for IVF in Alabama are still being considered."

I'm Taylor Wilson, and today is Thursday, March 7th, 2024. This is The Excerpt. Today, Alabama's legislature has passed IVF protections. Plus, what's next after Nikki Haley dropped out of the presidential race? And super bloom is coming.\n\n♦\n\nAlabama lawmakers gave final approval yesterday to legislation protecting in vitro fertilization providers and patients. The move comes less than a month after the state Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos are legally protected as children. Members of the State House passed the bill overwhelmingly 81 to 12, and the Senate did the same, voting to concur with a vote of 29 to 1. Republican governor, Kay Ivey, immediately signed the bill into law. The bipartisan legislation provides civil and criminal immunity to fertility clinics and doctors for the death or damage to an embryo during the IVF process. In the weeks after the state Supreme Court ruling, three of Alabama's largest IVF providers temporarily shut down out of fear of prosecution. Elected officials from across Alabama and the country spoke out in support of IVF, including both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.\n\n♦\n\nFormer South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley dropped out of the presidential race yesterday.\n\nNikki Haley:\n\nThe time has now come to suspend my campaign. I said I wanted Americans to have their voices heard. I have done that. I have no regrets. And although I will no longer be a candidate, I will not stop using my voice for the things I believe in.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nIn. She made the announcement acknowledging that former President Donald Trump will likely be the Republican Party nominee. Despite dropping out, Haley's campaign made history. She was the first woman to win a GOP primary, and the first Indian American presidential candidate to make it to Super Tuesday. And she defied most expectations. Still, she fell short as Trump's grip on the party continues. I spoke with USA TODAY White House correspondent Francesca Chambers for more. Hello, Francesca.\n\nFrancesca Chambers:\n\nHi again.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Francesca, Nikki Haley has dropped out, but how did she defy the odds during her campaign?\n\nFrancesca Chambers:\n\nWell, when you look back more than a year ago when she was the first challenger to get in the race against former President Donald Trump, she was low-polling, and while she had been twice-elected governor of South Carolina and she'd been a former UN ambassador, she was competing in a field that included former vice President Mike Pence, US Senator Tim Scott, as well as other sitting governors and former governors as well. And so she really had to break out of that pack, and she did so successfully on the debate stage. From there, you then saw her increase her polling in the state of New Hampshire, and that really gave her the momentum that she needed to be the last candidate standing against Donald Trump.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah, and she spent several weeks as that last GOP candidate standing with him. How exactly did we get to this point where it was just she and Trump left in the GOP field?\n\nFrancesca Chambers:\n\nShe had pushed for that really hard, she really wanted Ron DeSantis to get out of the race earlier in the year, and was able to make that happen after Iowa, when he came in second place. But it was a distant second to Donald Trump. And while she came in third, she hadn't entered Iowa saying that she was going to win Iowa. In fact, we always knew that she was putting more of her time into New Hampshire and really counting on that. So when he came in that second place, you felt the pressure on him to get out really increased. She was able to then turn it into a head-to-head against him in New Hampshire. Another key moment was Chris Christie dropping out of the race just before Iowa. He was not competing in Iowa, but that mattered for her in the state of New Hampshire where she really needed to consolidate his former supporters in order to boost turnout for her campaign.\n\nSo that allowed her to stay in the race until her home state of South Carolina voted to continue raising lots of money. She had said she needed to do better in South Carolina than she did in New Hampshire, and that didn't happen. But I'm told by people who were close to her that, at that point it was like, \"Listen, we're so close to Super Tuesday, what would be the point in getting out?\" So many people hadn't voted yet, Taylor, and they wanted to give Haley voters a choice in the election, the opportunity, in the primary election to cast a ballot for her in many of these states.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nFrancesca, I'm curious, did Haley have a fatal flaw that ultimately led us to this moment with her dropping out? Or is this really just more about Donald Trump's continued roaring support in the GOP?\n\nFrancesca Chambers:\n\nThat's something else I've been talking to her allies about over the last few days. I think their sense of it is that that's not necessarily true. That it wasn't always inevitable that Trump was going to be the nominee this cycle, that someone couldn't beat him. While that turned out to be the case, that's just not how they feel about it. Even in her speech yesterday, she said that she had no regrets on the campaign trail. When she sat down with reporters in Washington DC a few days ago, when I was one of them, she said a similar thing to me. And she told reporters then, that if she had went harder against him earlier in the race, that would've made her a Chris Christie. And so she and the people around her just thought that if she went harder against Trump earlier that she couldn't get the conservatives that she needed in the Republican primary to support her. And so she waited until later in the race when she had already established her conservative credentials in order to start attacking him more aggressively.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nIs Haley now expected to throw her support behind Trump the presumptive nominee?\n\nFrancesca Chambers:\n\nYeah, that's not something that she's planning to do at this time. She noted in her dropout speech that Trump will likely be the Republican nominee when the party convention meets in July, but she did not endorse him. She said that he needs to earn the votes of her supporters and people in the Republican Party who weren't supporting him in the primary election. And she said that politics should be about bringing people into your camp and not turning them away. And that's really a throwback to when he had said that anyone that donated to her after New Hampshire would be barred permanently from MAGA.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right. USA TODAY White House correspondent Francesca Chambers, joining us here on a busy political week. Thank you, Francesca.\n\nFrancesca Chambers:\n\nThank you so much.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has formally endorsed Donald Trump for another presidential term. And on the democratic side, Congressman Dean Phillips has suspended his primary challenge against President Joe Biden.\n\nThe House, yesterday, passed the first six spending bills needed to fund the government on a long-term basis. The move signals the beginning of the end of constant government shutdown scares on Capitol Hill. The legislation is expected to clear the Senate and then head to President Joe Biden's desk for his signature. Far more Democrats than Republicans supported the bill, despite the GOP's majority in the chamber. Every year, Congress has to pass 12 individual spending bills to keep the government's doors open. But recently, lawmakers have failed to meet their spending deadlines, so they tend to package the dozen bills together into a massive piece of legislation called an omnibus. But the first six of those spending bills were set to expire tomorrow. So to avoid a partial government shutdown, negotiators packaged the funding into one deal known as a minibus. The plan passed yesterday will fund parts of the government related to agriculture, veterans affairs and transportation, housing and urban development, among others. You can read more with a link in today's show notes.\n\n♦\n\nAfter this week's Super Tuesday contest, we now have a pretty good sense that we're marching toward a rematch between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. For more on that, and a look ahead to Biden's State of the Union address tonight, I caught up with USA TODAY, Washington Bureau Chief, Susan Page. Susan, thanks for hopping on today.\n\nSusan Page:\n\nIt's always my pleasure.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right. You did write that there are some differences this time around from 2020. For starters, it's now this kind of incumbent versus incumbent battle. Why might that be significant?\n\nSusan Page:\n\nWell, it's easier to be the challenger. If you're the incumbent, you have a record to defend. Some things may have gone very well, but some things invariably don't go so well. So last time around, Biden was the challenger, and Trump had the record. This time around, they both have records, but Biden has the closer, nearer record, the one that we're living through these days. So that means on issues like immigration, he owns the issue, and whatever problems there are along the southern border, they belong to him, not to Trump. That's a tougher situation for Biden to be in than he was last time around.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd speaking of Biden, there's been a lot of talk around his foreign policy amid his term in office. What are the major issues here and why are aspects of his foreign policy under fire?\n\nSusan Page:\n\nIt was a strength for him, I think, four years ago. Someone who knew foreign policy well, had a very long experience in the field as a senator and as vice president, and someone who promised to restore American credibility around the world. But he's got some problems. We had that withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan in 2021. That did not go well, 13 American service members lost their lives in that withdrawal. And more recently, we have a big response from especially younger and more progressive voters concerned that US support for Israel is contributing to a humanitarian catastrophe in the Gaza Strip. And we see that really creating problems for Biden, even in the Super Tuesday contest, when about 20% of democratic primary voters in Minnesota voted uncommitted. That's become a way to register protest with what's happening in Gaza.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd as for Trump, Susan, how does the public view the kind of Trump rhetoric and image at this point? Especially as he continues to face all these legal issues.\n\nSusan Page:\n\nHis tweets are no longer quite so front and center because he's posting on social media platforms that fewer people see. Now, I think we're still trying to figure out exactly what impact these trials might have on Trump. In the primaries, the fact that he has been indicted on 91 felony counts only galvanized his support in the GOP. But we do see signs in exit polls that as many as 40% of Republican primary voters in Virginia, for instance, said that they would consider him unfit for the presidency if he is convicted in one of those trials. And the first one is scheduled to start at the end of this month.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd of course, Susan, a big difference this time around is both candidates are older. In fact, as you wrote, we're all older at this point. What factor is age shaping up to play in this rematch?\n\nSusan Page:\n\nYeah, I'm older, you're older, Biden's older. And Biden was reasonably old last time around. He became the oldest person ever elected President of the United States. It wasn't such an issue for him last time around. And there was an assumption among many that he would run, win and only serve one term. But of course, he is now running for reelection, and questions about his age and his acuity have become very much part of the debate, that is part of the Republican strategy to portray Biden as not having the physical and mental health to be president. That's a question he's going to need to answer in this campaign.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd shifting to tonight, President Joe Biden will be making a State of the Union address. How big of a speech is this for him, Susan, and how do we expect him to frame it?\n\nSusan Page:\n\nIt's a big speech. It's always a big speech, big spotlight, a huge television audience. It could be the biggest television audience he gets this year. It's a chance to set the terms for this election year. It's a chance for him to look vigorous, to answer those questions we were just discussing about his age, to try to get hold of the immigration issue. It's the most damaging issue he has right now. It is a big opportunity. The stakes are really high.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSusan Page, is USA TODAY's Washington Bureau Chief. Thank you, Susan.\n\nSusan Page:\n\nThank you.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nBiden's State of the Union address is set for 9:00 PM Eastern Time tonight.\n\n♦\n\nIt's been another wet winter in the American West, torrential rains, flooding and mudslides have been the norm for months. But the rainbow is right around the corner. Wild flower blooms in California are expected to be spectacular this year. Blooms are usually especially stunning after a wet winter in the frequently dry West. And because last year was also a rainy year, this year's bloom could be even more stunning. And what's often called a super bloom. According to California State Parks, blooming wild flowers could include lupine, desert sunflowers, desert lilies, and more. If you're planning on checking out the flowers this spring, to protect fragile lands, remember to stay on designated trails, avoid trampling plants, and stick to taking pictures. Picking the flowers is prohibited and means they can't seed to bloom again.\n\n♦\n\nBe sure to stay tuned to The Excerpt later today when my co-host, Dana Taylor talks with microbiology and immunology expert, Dr. Arturo Casadevall on the growing threat of fungi.

I'm Taylor Wilson, and today is Thursday, March 7th, 2024. This is The Excerpt. Today, Alabama's legislature has passed IVF protections. Plus, what's next after Nikki Haley dropped out of the presidential race? And super bloom is coming.</p><p id=\"~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-national-2\" class=\"gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al\"></p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">&#9830;</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Alabama lawmakers gave final approval yesterday to legislation protecting in vitro fertilization providers and patients. The move comes less than a month after the state Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos are legally protected as children. Members of the State House passed the bill overwhelmingly 81 to 12, and the Senate did the same, voting to concur with a vote of 29 to 1. Republican governor, Kay Ivey, immediately signed the bill into law. The bipartisan legislation provides civil and criminal immunity to fertility clinics and doctors for the death or damage to an embryo during the IVF process. In the weeks after the state Supreme Court ruling, three of Alabama's largest IVF providers temporarily shut down out of fear of prosecution. Elected officials from across Alabama and the country spoke out in support of IVF, including both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.</p><p id=\"~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-national-3\" class=\"gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al\"></p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">&#9830;</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley dropped out of the presidential race yesterday.</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Nikki Haley:</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">The time has now come to suspend my campaign. I said I wanted Americans to have their voices heard. I have done that. I have no regrets. And although I will no longer be a candidate, I will not stop using my voice for the things I believe in.</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Taylor Wilson:</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">In. She made the announcement acknowledging that former President Donald Trump will likely be the Republican Party nominee. Despite dropping out, Haley's campaign made history. She was the first woman to win a GOP primary, and the first Indian American presidential candidate to make it to Super Tuesday. And she defied most expectations. Still, she fell short as Trump's grip on the party continues. I spoke with USA TODAY White House correspondent Francesca Chambers for more. Hello, Francesca.</p><p id=\"~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-national-4\" class=\"gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al\"></p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Francesca Chambers:</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Hi again.</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Taylor Wilson:</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">So Francesca, Nikki Haley has dropped out, but how did she defy the odds during her campaign?</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Francesca Chambers:</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Well, when you look back more than a year ago when she was the first challenger to get in the race against former President Donald Trump, she was low-polling, and while she had been twice-elected governor of South Carolina and she'd been a former UN ambassador, she was competing in a field that included former vice President Mike Pence, US Senator Tim Scott, as well as other sitting governors and former governors as well. And so she really had to break out of that pack, and she did so successfully on the debate stage. From there, you then saw her increase her polling in the state of New Hampshire, and that really gave her the momentum that she needed to be the last candidate standing against Donald Trump.</p><p id=\"~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-national-5\" class=\"gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al\"></p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Taylor Wilson:</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Yeah, and she spent several weeks as that last GOP candidate standing with him. How exactly did we get to this point where it was just she and Trump left in the GOP field?</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Francesca Chambers:</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">She had pushed for that really hard, she really wanted Ron DeSantis to get out of the race earlier in the year, and was able to make that happen after Iowa, when he came in second place. But it was a distant second to Donald Trump. And while she came in third, she hadn't entered Iowa saying that she was going to win Iowa. In fact, we always knew that she was putting more of her time into New Hampshire and really counting on that. So when he came in that second place, you felt the pressure on him to get out really increased. She was able to then turn it into a head-to-head against him in New Hampshire. Another key moment was Chris Christie dropping out of the race just before Iowa. He was not competing in Iowa, but that mattered for her in the state of New Hampshire where she really needed to consolidate his former supporters in order to boost turnout for her campaign.</p><p id=\"~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-national-6\" class=\"gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al\"></p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">So that allowed her to stay in the race until her home state of South Carolina voted to continue raising lots of money. She had said she needed to do better in South Carolina than she did in New Hampshire, and that didn't happen. But I'm told by people who were close to her that, at that point it was like, \"Listen, we're so close to Super Tuesday, what would be the point in getting out?\" So many people hadn't voted yet, Taylor, and they wanted to give Haley voters a choice in the election, the opportunity, in the primary election to cast a ballot for her in many of these states.</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Taylor Wilson:</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Francesca, I'm curious, did Haley have a fatal flaw that ultimately led us to this moment with her dropping out? Or is this really just more about Donald Trump's continued roaring support in the GOP?</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Francesca Chambers:</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">That's something else I've been talking to her allies about over the last few days. I think their sense of it is that that's not necessarily true. That it wasn't always inevitable that Trump was going to be the nominee this cycle, that someone couldn't beat him. While that turned out to be the case, that's just not how they feel about it. Even in her speech yesterday, she said that she had no regrets on the campaign trail. When she sat down with reporters in Washington DC a few days ago, when I was one of them, she said a similar thing to me. And she told reporters then, that if she had went harder against him earlier in the race, that would've made her a Chris Christie. And so she and the people around her just thought that if she went harder against Trump earlier that she couldn't get the conservatives that she needed in the Republican primary to support her. And so she waited until later in the race when she had already established her conservative credentials in order to start attacking him more aggressively.</p><p id=\"~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-national-7\" class=\"gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al\"></p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Taylor Wilson:</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Is Haley now expected to throw her support behind Trump the presumptive nominee?</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Francesca Chambers:</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Yeah, that's not something that she's planning to do at this time. She noted in her dropout speech that Trump will likely be the Republican nominee when the party convention meets in July, but she did not endorse him. She said that he needs to earn the votes of her supporters and people in the Republican Party who weren't supporting him in the primary election. And she said that politics should be about bringing people into your camp and not turning them away. And that's really a throwback to when he had said that anyone that donated to her after New Hampshire would be barred permanently from MAGA.</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Taylor Wilson:</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">All right. USA TODAY White House correspondent Francesca Chambers, joining us here on a busy political week. Thank you, Francesca.</p><p id=\"~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-national-8\" class=\"gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al\"></p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Francesca Chambers:</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Thank you so much.</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">&#9830;</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Taylor Wilson:</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Meanwhile, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has formally endorsed Donald Trump for another presidential term. And on the democratic side, Congressman Dean Phillips has suspended his primary challenge against President Joe Biden.</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">The House, yesterday, passed the first six spending bills needed to fund the government on a long-term basis. The move signals the beginning of the end of constant government shutdown scares on Capitol Hill. The legislation is expected to clear the Senate and then head to President Joe Biden's desk for his signature. Far more Democrats than Republicans supported the bill, despite the GOP's majority in the chamber. Every year, Congress has to pass 12 individual spending bills to keep the government's doors open. But recently, lawmakers have failed to meet their spending deadlines, so they tend to package the dozen bills together into a massive piece of legislation called an omnibus. But the first six of those spending bills were set to expire tomorrow. So to avoid a partial government shutdown, negotiators packaged the funding into one deal known as a minibus. The plan passed yesterday will fund parts of the government related to agriculture, veterans affairs and transportation, housing and urban development, among others.

For more on that, and a look ahead to Biden's State of the Union address tonight, I caught up with USA TODAY, Washington Bureau Chief, Susan Page. Susan, thanks for hopping on today.</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Susan Page:</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">It's always my pleasure.</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Taylor Wilson:</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">All right. You did write that there are some differences this time around from 2020. For starters, it's now this kind of incumbent versus incumbent battle. Why might that be significant?</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Susan Page:</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Well, it's easier to be the challenger. If you're the incumbent, you have a record to defend. Some things may have gone very well, but some things invariably don't go so well. So last time around, Biden was the challenger, and Trump had the record. This time around, they both have records, but Biden has the closer, nearer record, the one that we're living through these days. So that means on issues like immigration, he owns the issue, and whatever problems there are along the southern border, they belong to him, not to Trump. That's a tougher situation for Biden to be in than he was last time around.</p><p id=\"~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-national-10\" class=\"gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al\"></p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Taylor Wilson:</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">And speaking of Biden, there's been a lot of talk around his foreign policy amid his term in office.

                        "publisher": "The Atlantic",
                        "newstext": "This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.\n\nNot long before Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Tom Parker issued an opinion citing the Bible as the basis for declaring that frozen embryos are people, he was a guest on a YouTube show hosted by a self-described prophet named Johnny Enlow. Parker’s appearance on such a program reveals a lot about the rising political power of the country’s fastest-growing Christian movement.\n\nOver the years, Enlow has written about how “a government can potentially function as a virtual theocracy” if leaders faithfully listen to God. He is a top promoter of the idea that Christians need to assert dominion over “seven mountains” of life—government, business, family, education, media, religion, and the arts. In recent months, he has said that Donald Trump could be justified in calling for “revolution” and interviewed a former Army major who runs an Idaho tactical-weapons training camp billed as being for “Christian men who believe the times warrant a high standard of firearms readiness.”\n\nStephanie McCrummen: The woman who bought a mountain for God\n\nNow Enlow was introducing Parker as another “asset,” a “fellow Kingdom lover.” He invited the 72-year-old judge to talk about how God had called him “to the mountain of government.”\n\n“As you have emphasized in the past, we have abandoned those seven mountains, and they’ve been occupied by the opposite side,” said Parker, who was elected to Alabama’s highest court in 2004 and has been chief justice since 2019. “I will say that God created government, and the fact that we have let it go into the possession of others is heartbreaking.” The two went on talking about the Holy Spirit and, quoting the Book of Isaiah, about “restoring the judges as in the days of old.”\n\nThis language, which can be mystifying to those not steeped in it, is commonly categorized as fundamentalism or Christian nationalism. But those terms do not adequately capture the scope and ambitions of the rapidly growing charismatic Christian movement with which Parker has publicly associated himself—a world of megachurches, modern-day apostles and prophets, media empires, worship bands, and millions of followers that is becoming the most aggressive faction of the Christian right and the leading edge of charismatic Christianity worldwide.\n\nThese are not blue-blazer Southern Baptists. This is the demon-mapping, prophecy-believing, spiritual-warfare, end-times-army, take-the-U.S.-Capitol-for-the-heavenly-Kingdom crowd—a movement that has its own history, its own superstars, and an agenda that goes beyond saving souls, or drawing upon faith to influence policy, as Americans of many religions do.\n\nThe movement is often called the New Apostolic Reformation, a phrase coined in the mid-1990s by a theology professor named C. Peter Wagner and once openly embraced by many leaders. Wagner was trying to describe what he said he was witnessing in churches not only in the United States but also in parts of Latin America, Africa, and China: explosive growth, miracles, signs and wonders. He believed that a fresh wave of the Holy Spirit was moving around the globe, obliterating denominational differences, banishing demonic strongholds, raising up new apostles and prophets with new dreams and visions for humanity. A great restoration of the first-century Church was under way, he contended. The end game would be an actual, earthly Kingdom of God.\n\nPeter Wehner: Where did evangelicals go wrong?\n\nWagner himself became a major figure in the movement, taking part in the first international convening of apostles in 2000 and writing books such as Dominion! How Kingdom Action Can Change the World. Years later, the movement is supplying an argument for authoritarianism, becoming a political force behind the rise of leaders such as Trump and Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro. Prophets and apostles are everywhere, describing God-given dreams and visions on their podcasts and social media. The movement is competing with Catholicism in many Brazilian villages; setting up in storefronts in Nairobi, Kenya; and filling moribund churches from California to the Deep South.\n\nI have visited many of these churches across the United States in my reporting. Inside, the walls are usually blank. No portraits of Jesus, no crosses. Some have Broadway-quality lighting. Instead of a pulpit, there is typically a huge screen showing futuristic scenes—spinning stars, crashing waves. Praise bands blast songs with simple chord progressions and mantralike choruses about submission to God. Many people pray lying prostrate on the floor. Sermons explain life as an ever-escalating spiritual battle between the forces of God and Satan, one in which Mr. Splitfoot might take the form of Joe Biden, Democrats, your local librarian, homosexual impulses, drugs, abortion—anything and anyone in the way of God’s Kingdom.\n\nCrucially, followers are urged to join in this great, rolling drama. In sermons, YouTube shows, books, and training academies, leaders in the movement urge people to listen to God and figure out which of the seven mountains is theirs.\n\nA North Carolina apostle named Greg Hood started something called Kingdom University to create what he calls Kingdom citizens. Businesspeople have started “Kingdom-aligned” investment firms. A woman I profiled last year had felt God telling her to buy a mountain in Western Pennsylvania, and she did, aiming to build a retreat center for people to learn their Kingdom assignments.\n\nIn Alabama, Justice Tom Parker decided that his mountain is government.\n\n“When the judges are restored, revival can flow,” he said on a prayer call convened last March by a prominent apostle named Clay Nash, one of 50 such calls in 2023 that routinely featured state legislators, members of Congress, judges, and other officials reporting on their progress building the Kingdom. “So, I have been laboring. I’m part of it in Alabama … At least as chief justice, I can help prepare the soil of the hearts, exposing the judges around the state to the things of God. I want to ask that we focus, going forward, on judges as one of the components to revival in this nation.”\n\nOn the steps of the Alabama capitol building last year, Parker—who declined to be interviewed for this article—introduced Sean Feucht, a popular singer in the movement who was touring state capitals and who told one crowd, “We want believers to be the ones writing the laws! Yes!” and “We want God to be in control of everything!” Parker prayed for “a comprehensive awakening across the state that will be so powerful that it will bring forth reformation in government that will affect the nation.”\n\nOn Enlow’s show, the host asked Parker to talk about how he felt doing his job.\n\n“Do you feel angels are attentive?” Enlow asked him. “Do you feel warfare?”\n\n“We know God equips those he calls,” Parker said. “And I am very aware he is equipping me with something for the specific situation I am facing.”\n\n“So you do feel like the Holy Spirit is there?” Enlow asked him.\n\n“Yes,” Parker said.\n\nThe judge went on to explain his legal philosophy. He said that there is natural law and God’s law, and that God’s law is necessary because man cannot trust his own reason. “Because of the impact of the fall of man in the Garden, man’s reason became corrupted and could no longer properly discern God’s law from nature,” Parker said. “So he had to give them the revealed law. The holy scripture.”\n\nRead: How politics poisoned the evangelical Church\n\nNot long after recording the show, the judge issued his concurring opinion in the in-vitro-fertilization case, eschewing secular sources to cite the Books of Genesis, Exodus, and Jeremiah as the ultimate authority in defining “the sanctity of human life.” The backlash has been swift, and the Alabama legislature voted Thursday to protect doctors doing IVF from criminal or civil liability if embryos are destroyed. But the New Apostolic Reformation remains a gathering force in American politics.\n\n“The Parker point of view, the NAR point of view, is deep and complicated,” Frederick Clarkson, a research analyst who has been studying the Christian right for decades, told me. He considers the NAR to be one of the most important shifts in Christianity in modern times. “Christian nationalism is a handy term, but it is a box into which NAR does not quite fit,” Clarkson said—the movement is “so much bigger than that.”\n\nThe people who advanced the notion that God was using Trump were not merely Christian nationalists. They were prominent apostles such as Dutch Sheets, who is as familiar to those in the movement as Billy Graham once was to your average Southern Baptist.\n\nSheets was a key figure in the run-up to January 6, exhorting his followers to go to Washington, D.C., to take the Capitol not just for Trump but for God. They came by the busload, bearing the Revolutionary War–era flag that Sheets popularized and repurposed as a symbol of the Kingdom movement.\n\nThe flag is white with a green pine tree and the words An Appeal to Heaven, and it is now posted outside the district office of House Speaker Mike Johnson. As wild and hyperbolic as the movement can seem to outsiders, believers continue to prove their seriousness, in Alabama and beyond.",

Parker&#8217;s appearance on such a program reveals a lot about the rising political power of the country&#8217;s fastest-growing Christian movement.</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">Over the years, Enlow has written about how &#8220;a government can potentially function as a virtual theocracy&#8221; if leaders faithfully listen to God. He is a top promoter of the idea that Christians need to assert dominion over &#8220;seven mountains&#8221; of life&#8212;government, business, family, education, media, religion, and the arts. In recent months, he has said that Donald Trump could be justified in calling for &#8220;revolution&#8221; and interviewed a former Army major who runs an Idaho tactical-weapons training camp billed as being for &#8220;Christian men who believe the times warrant a high standard of firearms readiness.&#8221;</p><p id=\"injected-recirculation-link-0\" class=\"ArticleRelatedContentLink_root__VYc9V\"><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/christian-movement-new-apostolic-reformation-politics-trump/674320/\">Stephanie McCrummen: The woman who bought a mountain for God</a></p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">Now Enlow was introducing Parker as another &#8220;asset,&#8221; a &#8220;fellow Kingdom lover.&#8221; He invited the 72-year-old judge to talk about how God had called him &#8220;to the mountain of government.&#8221;</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">&#8220;As you have emphasized in the past, we have abandoned those seven mountains, and they&#8217;ve been occupied by the opposite side,&#8221; said Parker, who was elected to Alabama&#8217;s highest court in 2004 and has been chief justice since 2019. &#8220;I will say that God created government, and the fact that we have let it go into the possession of others is heartbreaking.&#8221; The two went on talking about the Holy Spirit and, quoting the Book of Isaiah, about &#8220;restoring the judges as in the days of old.&#8221;</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">This language, which can be mystifying to those not steeped in it, is commonly categorized as fundamentalism or Christian nationalism. But those terms do not adequately capture the scope and ambitions of the rapidly growing charismatic Christian movement with which Parker has publicly associated himself&#8212;a world of megachurches, modern-day apostles and prophets, media empires, worship bands, and millions of followers that is becoming the most aggressive faction of the Christian right and the leading edge of charismatic Christianity worldwide.</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">These are not blue-blazer Southern Baptists. This is the demon-mapping, prophecy-believing, spiritual-warfare, end-times-army, take-the-U.S.-Capitol-for-the-heavenly-Kingdom crowd&#8212;a movement that has its own history, its own superstars, and an agenda that goes beyond saving souls, or drawing upon faith to influence policy, as Americans of many religions do.</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">The movement is often called the New Apostolic Reformation, a phrase coined in the mid-1990s by a theology professor named C. Peter Wagner and once openly embraced by many leaders. Wagner was trying to describe what he said he was witnessing in churches not only in the United States but also in parts of Latin America, Africa, and China: explosive growth, miracles, signs and wonders. He believed that a fresh wave of the Holy Spirit was moving around the globe, obliterating denominational differences, banishing demonic strongholds, raising up new apostles and prophets with new dreams and visions for humanity. A great restoration of the first-century Church was under way, he contended. The end game would be an actual, earthly Kingdom of God.</p><p id=\"injected-recirculation-link-1\" class=\"ArticleRelatedContentLink_root__VYc9V\"><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/03/evangelical-support-republican-trump/677610/\">Peter Wehner: Where did evangelicals go wrong?</a></p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">Wagner himself became a major figure in the movement, taking part in the first international convening of apostles in 2000 and writing books such as Dominion! How Kingdom Action Can Change the World. Years later, the movement is supplying an argument for authoritarianism, becoming a political force behind the rise of leaders such as Trump and Brazil&#8217;s Jair Bolsonaro.

NAR advocates for Christian dominion over various societal spheres, including government. Parker's recent concurring opinion citing the Bible as a basis for declaring embryos as people showcases the movement's impact on policymaking. NAR leaders like Johnny Enlow and Dutch Sheets have promoted the idea of \"restoring the judges\" and installing Christian authority figures in leadership roles, with the ultimate goal of establishing an earthly Kingdom of God. The movement's focus on spiritual warfare and demon-mapping, as well as its political aspirations, has drawn comparisons to Christian nationalism but is considered to be broader in scope and ambition. NAR's influence is not limited to Alabama, with followers and leaders actively engaging in politics across the country."

                "newstext": "WASHINGTON – Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., will deliver the Republican response to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address Thursday evening.\n\nBut who is the first-term lawmaker? Britt, 42, is the youngest Republican woman to ever be elected to the upper chamber and is considered a rising star among a party dominated by older men. On Thursday night, she'll also offer a contrast to President Joe Biden, the oldest sitting president in American history.\n\nShe has two children still in middle and high school and said in a statement ahead of the speech that the Republican Party is the party of \"hard-working parents and families.\"\n\n“President Biden is out of touch and off the pace — and the consequences are endangering America’s future,” she said. “I’m looking forward to sharing our positive vision to secure the American Dream for generations to come.”\n\nBritt serves on the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, as well as the Rules Committee and the Banking, Housing and Urban Development Committee.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"I think she represents the future of the Republican Party,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told USA TODAY. Asked why she was chosen to deliver the speech, he said: \"She's got young children, she's a very articulate, optimistic kind of person. I think she's a great pick.\"\n\nBritt's office declined an interview request from USA TODAY.\n\nSenate experience – and a Trump endorsement\n\nBritt got her start in politics in former Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby's office as a press secretary, before going to law school and beginning work as an attorney. More than a decade after first working in Shelby's office, she rejoined his staff on his reelection campaign and then as his chief of staff. She also served as the president and CEO of the Business Council of Alabama.\n\n\"I don't remember ever seeing somebody come into the Senate and hit the ground running faster than she has, both because of her innate abilities and because of her experience,\" said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump endorsed her when she ran for Senate in 2022, after pulling his support for her Republican primary opponent, former U.S. Rep. Mo Brooks. Trump initially opposed Britt, who had received funding from a super PAC aligned with Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., but he threw his weight behind her campaign when polls indicated she had a huge lead over Brooks.\n\nWhen she was sworn in to office in 2023, she became Alabama's first female senator, replacing her former boss.\n\nAnd now, Britt is preparing to lay out Republican priorities following Biden's State of the Union address. The assignment of delivering the rebuttal to the president's annual speech is framed as a chance for rising stars to make their mark. Prominent current and former officials such as Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C. and former House Speaker Paul Ryan have all given the GOP response in the past.\n\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Sunday that Britt's speech is even a \"big audition\" to be Trump's pick for vice president if she \"rises to the occasion.\"\n\nBut it can also be an opportunity for public blunders that can make a lasting impression. For example, former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal's reputation took a hit after a \"cheesy\" and awkward response to then-President Barack Obama's 2009 State of the Union speech.\n\nThe shadow of the Alabama Supreme Court's IVF ruling\n\nBritt's speech will come just over two weeks after the Supreme Court in her home state issued a decision that rocked families across the country: The Alabama high court determined that frozen embryos used in IVF are children and have legal protections under state law.\n\nThe decision kicked off a frenzy among patients and doctors grappling with its implications for people attempting to conceive, often after years of struggling to have children. The University of Alabama at Birmingham and other facilities in the state quickly paused some infertility treatments after the ruling due to concerns about criminal liability surrounding the handling of embryos.\n\nRepublicans came out en masse to note their support for the procedure. They also called upon the Alabama state legislature to ensure families can continue to use IVF without fears of legal issues.\n\nBritt, too, came out in support of IVF after the ruling. She has said she believes life begins at conception and identifies as \"pro-life,\" but she said in the wake of the decision that \"defending life and ensuring continued access to IVF services for loving parents are not mutually exclusive.\"\n\nIt's not an argument her critics have bought. The Democratic National Committee called Britt \"an anti-choice extremist\" in a statement.\n\n\"Make no mistake: Britt and her fellow MAGA extremists are backing a cruel, dangerous, and unpopular anti-choice agenda that would outlaw abortion nationwide and risk access to IVF for Americans trying to grow their family,\" DNC spokesperson Alex Floyd said.\n\nWhen Democrats in the Senate tried to advance a bill that would enact federal protections for the fertility procedure, Republicans largely would not commit to supporting it. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., blocked the proposal on the Senate floor.\n\nBut as Britt responds to the president on Thursday, IVF and concerns surrounding the procedure are widely expected to be part of the conservative lawmaker's remarks.",

                "newstext": "WORCESTER ― Police have issued an arrest warrant against a Worcester man, Dejan D. Belnavis, in connection with the fatal shooting of a mother and her daughter Tuesday inside an SUV on Englewood Avenue and have separately arrested another man in connection with the shooting.\n\nThe police identified the victims as Chasity Nunez and her 11-year-old daughter, Zella Nunez. Zella attended Worcester schools.\n\nBelnavis, 27, whom court papers list as living on Toronita Avenue, is charged with armed assault with intent to murder and carrying a firearm without a license, court papers show.\n\nThe search continued Thursday morning.\n\nMore:Worcester police: Englewood Avenue shooting victims were mother and daughter\n\nPolice allege in court papers that Belnavis is one of two people surveillance video shows opening fire on the SUV a little after 3 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nWorcester police spokesman Lt. Sean Murtha confirmed Wednesday night that another man has been arrested in connection with the homicide. Karel Mangual of Sterling Street is charged with armed assault to murder and carrying a firearm with out a license, according to police.\n\nHe is due in Central District Court Thursday. In 2015, Mangual was arrested after what Worcester police called a retaliatory shooting behind an apartment building on View Street. Authorities connected the attack to the fatal shooting of Christian Obeng-Addo days earlier.\n\nIn the latest case, police wrote in court documents seeking a warrant for Belnavis that the surveillance video shows “the victims parked in their vehicle and that two people walk up to the vehicle and start shooting.”\n\nThey said the shooters then ran in the direction where a witness said a white sedan was parked. Surveillance video, police said, showed a vehicle “consistent” with the sedan circling the area before the shooting and leaving the area afterward.\n\nPolice were able to track the sedan to its owner, who told them Belnavis had borrowed it for about a year. Belnavis was listed as the driver of the car following a Shrewsbury crash in January, they said, and his cellphone records tie him to Englewood Avenue at the time of the shooting.\n\n“Realizing the need to locate this vehicle after the murder of two people and the danger presented to the public, we used the vehicle’s connected car system, through AT&T and we were able to locate the vehicle in Hartford, Connecticut,” police wrote, adding they learned Belnavis had a relative close to where the vehicle was parked in Hartford.\n\nPolice allege in court documents that video shows Mangual and Belvanis exiting the vehicle in Hartford, and that both men were wearing shoes similar to the ones worn by the shooters.\n\nPolice said Belnavis does not have a license to carry and “does have prior firearm charges in 2021.”\n\nCity leaders Wednesday released a statement on the deaths, saying such violence has no place in Worcester.\n\nThe statement from City Manager Eric D. Batista, Mayor Joseph M. Petty, Interim Police Chief Paul Saucier and Schools Superintendent Rachel Monárrez reads, in part: \"Worcester is a resilient community, and we know that our residents will lovingly embrace the victims’ family and friends as we work toward healing from this traumatic event.”\n\nZella was involved in the Our Bright Future youth program.\n\n\"Zella, you are loved, and may you both rest in peace,\" the organization wrote on social media.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday evening, City Councilor Khrystian E. King offered condolences for family members and school-aged peers: \"Those responsible for these depraved killings must be brought to justice, in full cooperation with local law enforcement.\"\n\nAsked about the comment Wednesday night, King told the T&G he is concerned more violence could follow.\n\nGov. Maura Healey characterized the killing as \"a trauma\" for the city. Healey was in Worcester Thursday morning for an event hosted by the Worcester Regional Chamber of Commerce at the AC Hotels by Marriott.\n\n“Chasity and Zella Nunez, a mom and her daughter, lost their lives to a violent act,\" Healey said in a statement later released by her staff. \"Members of the Worcester Public Schools community are with us, and while I know they must be shaken themselves, they are continuing to help students process this frightening and senseless loss.\"\n\nIt was the second daylight shooting in Worcester in as many days. Monday, an 18-year-old male was injured by gunfire in the area of 2 Main St., near the old Worcester County Courthouse. The 4:30 p.m. shooting remains under investigation.\n\n-With reports from staff writer Toni Caushi",

                "newstext": "CAIRO (AP) — Hamas said Thursday that its delegation has left Cairo and that talks on a Gaza cease-fire and hostage release will resume next week, making it extremely unlikely that mediators will broker a deal before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.\n\nMediators had looked to Ramadan as an informal deadline because the month of dawn-to-dusk fasting often sees Israeli-Palestinian violence linked to access to a major Jerusalem holy site. The war already has the wider region on edge, with Iran-backed groups trading fire with Israel and the United States.\n\nEgyptian officials had earlier said the negotiations had reached an impasse over Hamas’ demand for a phased process culminating in an end to the war. But they did not rule out a deal before Ramadan, which is expected to begin on Sunday.\n\nHamas spokesman Jihad Taha said Israel “refuses to commit to and give guarantees regarding the cease-fire, the return of the displaced, and withdrawal from the areas of its incursion.” But he said the talks were still ongoing and would resume next week. There was no immediate comment from Israel.\n\nThe U.S., Egypt and Qatar have been trying for weeks to broker an agreement on a six-week cease-fire and the release of 40 hostages held in Gaza in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned in Israel.\n\nThe Egyptian officials said Hamas has agreed to the main terms of such an agreement as a first stage but wants commitments that it will lead to an eventual more permanent cease-fire. They say Israel wants to confine the negotiations to the more limited agreement.\n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the negotiations with media. Both officials said mediators are still pressing the two parties to soften their positions.\n\nHamas has said it will not release all of the remaining hostages without a full Israeli withdrawal from the territory. Palestinian militants are believed to be holding around 100 hostages and the remains of 30 others captured during Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack into Israel that triggered the war.\n\nHamas is also demanding the release of a large number of prisoners, including top militants serving life sentences, in exchange for the remaining hostages.\n\nHamas is believed to be holding the hostages deep inside its vast tunnel network, where rescue operations would be virtually impossible, and using them as human shields for its top leaders. It hopes to use them as bargaining chips to end the war on its terms.\n\nThat poses a major dilemma for Israel, which at some point may have to choose between its two main goals of bringing back the hostages and trying to annihilate Hamas.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly ruled out Hamas’ demands, saying Israel intends to resume the offensive after any cease-fire, expand it to the crowded southern city of Rafah and battle on until “total victory.” He has said military pressure will help bring about the release of the hostages.\n\nRamadan is a time of heightened prayer, reflection and charity for Muslims the world over, who hold festive nightly gatherings with family and friends after fasting ends at sundown. The lunar month is expected to begin Sunday or Monday, depending on the sighting of the moon.\n\nIn past years, Israeli forces and Palestinians have clashed in Jerusalem over access to the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, the third holiest site in Islam. The hilltop on which it is built is the holiest site for Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount because it was the location of the Jewish temples in antiquity.\n\nHamas says it launched the Oct. 7 attack partly in response to what it sees as Israel’s encroachment on the site and has called for heightened confrontations with Israel during the holy month. Israeli authorities say access to the site will remain unchanged from previous years.\n\nHamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and captured another 250 when they stormed across the border on Oct. 7. Over 100 hostages were released in a cease-fire deal last year.\n\nIsrael launched a massive air, land and sea campaign in Gaza that has driven some 80% of the population from their homes and pushed hundreds of thousands to the brink of famine.\n\nGaza’s Health Ministry says at least 30,717 Palestinians have been killed. It does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its tallies but says women and children make up around two-thirds of those killed. The ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government, maintains detailed records and its casualty figures from previous wars have largely matched those of the U.N. and independent experts.\n\nIsrael says it has killed over 13,000 Hamas fighters, without providing evidence. It blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas because its fighters operate in dense, residential neighborhoods.\n\nGaza is mired in a humanitarian crisis, and conditions are particularly dire in the north, where the offensive has caused widespread devastation. Many of the estimated 300,000 people still living there have been reduced to eating animal fodder to survive, and the U.N. says one in six children younger than 2 in the north suffers from acute malnutrition.\n\nFacing global calls to alleviate the crisis, Israeli officials said Wednesday that it will begin allowing aid to move directly from its territory into northern Gaza and will also cooperate with the creation of a sea route from Cyprus.\n\nAid groups have said it has become nearly impossible to deliver supplies within most of Gaza because of the difficulty of coordinating with the Israeli military, the ongoing hostilities and the breakdown of public order. It is even more difficult to get aid to the north.\n\n___\n\nSewell reported from Beirut.\n\n___\n\nFind more of AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war",

                        "newstext": "CAIRO (AP) — President Joe Biden will announce a plan in his State of the Union address Thursday night for the U.S. military to help establish a temporary port on the Gaza coast aimed at increasing the flow of humanitarian aid into the beleaguered territory during the Israel-Hamas war, according to senior administration officials.\n\nThe officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preview the announcement, said the operation will not require that American troops be on the ground to build the pier that is intended to allow more shipments of food, medicine and other essential items.\n\nThe officials did not provide details about how the pier would be built. One noted that the U.S. military has “unique capabilities” and can do things from “just offshore.” They said it would likely take weeks before it was operational.\n\nThe move provides one more layer to the extraordinary dynamic that’s emerged as the United States has had to go around Israel, its main Mideast ally, and find ways to get aid into Gaza, including through airdrops.\n\nBiden last week first raised the idea of establishing a sea-based corridor, saying the U.S. was working with allies on how it might provide assistance from the Mediterranean to those in Gaza.\n\nAmerican Gen. Erik Kurilla, head of U.S. Central Command, told the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee that he had briefed officials on such a maritime option. Also Thursday, the U.S. conducted a third airdrop in the northern part of Gaza, where there is no Israeli presence. Kurilla said Central Command has provided options for increasing the number of trucks taking aid to those areas.\n\nFive months of fighting between Israel and Hamas have left much of Hamas-run Gaza in ruins and led to a worsening humanitarian catastrophe. Many Palestinians, especially in the devastated north, are scrambling for food to survive.\n\nAid groups have said it has become nearly impossible to deliver supplies within most of Gaza because of the difficulty of coordinating with the Israeli military, the ongoing hostilities and the breakdown of public order.\n\nThe announcement of plans to build the temporary port comes as Hamas said its delegation had left Cairo and that talks on a cease-fire and hostage release would resume next week, making it extremely unlikely that mediators will broker a deal before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.\n\nMediators had looked to Ramadan as an informal deadline because the month of dawn-to-dusk fasting often sees Israeli-Palestinian violence linked to access to a major Jerusalem holy site.

There was no immediate comment from Israel.\n\nThe U.S., Egypt and Qatar have been trying for weeks to broker an agreement on a six-week cease-fire and the release of 40 hostages held in Gaza in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned in Israel.\n\nThe Egyptian officials said Hamas has agreed to the main terms of such an agreement as a first stage but wants commitments that it will lead to an eventual more permanent cease-fire. They say Israel wants to confine the negotiations to the more limited agreement.\n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the negotiations with media.

If the US gets nervous and anxious when it hears the word ‘China,’ where is its confidence as a major power?” he said. “If the US is obsessed with suppressing China, it will eventually harm itself.”\n\nWang, a 70-year-old veteran diplomat who has earned Xi’s trust, returned to the foreign minister’s post last summer after his successor, Qin Gang, was abruptly dismissed without explanation after a half year on the job. Wang is also the ruling Communist Party’s top foreign affairs official, a more senior position that he moved to when Qin became foreign minister at the end of 2022.\n\nWang also reiterated a Chinese call to make Palestine a full member of the United Nations.\n\nAnalysts had speculated the Communist Party might use the weeklong meeting of the National People’s Congress to name a new foreign minister, but that appeared off the table after an agenda released on the eve of the opening session did not include personnel changes.\n\nChina’s UN ambassador, Zhang Jun, said during a Security Council debate in January that China supports Palestine becoming a full member as soon as possible, as a first step toward creating a Palestinian state, according to Chinese media reports.\n\nWang called Thursday for a major international conference to draw up a roadmap and timetable for a two-state solution.\n\n4 China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi attends a press conference for the Second Session of the 14th National People’s Congress (NPC) in Beijing on March 7, 2024.

AP\n\nThe Philippines and the US have accused China of aggressive tactics in trying to block Philippines ships from reaching reefs and other outcroppings that both sides claim, most recently in a collision between coast guard vessels of both countries this week.\n\n“For unreasonable provocations, we will take just countermeasures,” Wang said. “We also advise certain countries outside the region not to stir up trouble, choose sides, and not to become disruptors and troublemakers in the South China Sea.”\n\nHe said countries that insist on maintaining official ties with Taiwan are interfering in China’s domestic affairs. Most countries, including the United States, don’t have diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but China objects to visits by US lawmakers to the island and US sales of military equipment for its defense.\n\n4 The US and EU expanded sanctions on companies and individuals from China and several other countries two weeks ago for allegedly aiding Russia’s war effort. REUTERS\n\nChina will continue to work for peaceful reunification with Taiwan, Wang said, but warned that anyone who supports independence for Taiwan would pay a price. Most Taiwanese prefer to remain separate from China without antagonizing it.\n\nThey fear Chinese rule could endanger their freedoms and democracy, particularly after China’s crackdown on Hong Kong.\n\n“Our bottom line is also very clear,” Wang said. “That is Taiwan will never be allowed to split from the motherland.”\n\nStart your day with all you need to know Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more.

                        "newstext": "Beijing CNN —\n\nChina’s top diplomat hit out at Washington’s “bewildering” trade policy during a news conference Thursday on the sidelines of a political gathering in Beijing, where Chinese leaders have been championing high-tech development in the face of mounting curbs from Washington.\n\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi accused the US of “devising various tactics to suppress China” and said Washington’s “lengthening” unilateral sanctions list had reached “bewildering levels of unfathomable absurdity.”\n\n“If it gets jittery whenever it hears the word China, where is its confidence as a major country?” Wang said in a response to a question about trade with the US and technological restrictions.\n\n“If it only wants itself to prosper, but denies other countries legitimate development, where is international fairness? If it persistently monopolizes the high end of the value chain and keeps China at the low end, where is fairness and competition?”\n\nWang made the comments during an annual Foreign Minister’s briefing held during each “two sessions” gathering of China’s rubber stamp legislature and its top political advisory body. Though highly choreographed, the more than hour-long engagement is a key opportunity for China’s top diplomat to express the country’s foreign policy vision directly to reporters from media around the world.\n\nIn a stark contrast to his comments on the US, Wang praised China’s burgeoning relationship and record trade with Russia – highlighting this near the top of his press conference when a Russian state media reporter was the first question taken from a foreign reporter.\n\nWang’s comments on the US come as Washington continues its drive to narrow the kinds of high-end technology that can be accessed by China. In October, the White House further reduced the types of semiconductors that US companies can sell in China as it aims to ensure American tech won’t be used to bolster the Chinese military.\n\nThe US has also enacted sanctions against Chinese actors over a host of issues in recent years, including allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang, the illicit fentanyl trade and providing support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWang spoke during what has been a period of relative stability between the China and the US. Adopting a softer tone at times, Wang noted that there had been “some improvements” in the US-China relationship since a summit between US President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in San Francisco last November.\n\nHe called on Washington to work with Beijing “to bring the relationship back on the track of stable, sound and sustainable development.”\n\nWhat has been on the agenda at the meetings this week is China’s drive to bolster its “self-reliance and strength in science and technology,” with Beijing sending a message that it will boost its self-reliance rather than sit back and wait for tech frictions with the US to improve.\n\nThe government announced plans to increase its annual budget for science and technology by 10% to an unprecedented 370.8 billion yuan ($51.6 billion) — the biggest jump since 2019 after years of minimal growth.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback China sets ambitious economic growth target for 2024 02:18 - Source: CNN\n\nRussian relations\n\nWang also praised robust trade ties between China and Russia, which have deepened following the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine and Moscow’s subsequent economic isolation on the global stage.\n\nBilateral trade between China and Russia hit a historic $240 billion last year, surpassing a target of $200 billion set by Xi and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in 2019 ahead of schedule.\n\n“Russian natural gas is fueling numerous Chinese households and Chinese-made automobiles are running on Russian roads,” Wang said. “All this shows the strong resilience and broad prospects of China-Russia mutually beneficial cooperation.”\n\nBeijing’s ties to Moscow have sparked deep suspicion in the West, including over concerns about China’s position as the Kremlin’s key economic lifeline. While China claims neutrality in the Ukraine conflict it has appeared unwilling to use its significant economic leverage to curb Russia’s aggression and has not condemned the invasion.\n\nDuring the briefing, Wang repeated China’s call for peace talks to avoid an “unthinkable” escalation and deterioration of the conflict. He also reiterated past rhetoric framing China’s relationship with Russia as a responsible one.\n\nMaintaining and growing the China-Russia relationship is a “strategic choice” by the two sides based on their fundamental interests and is also “what we must do to keep pace with the trend of the world,” Wang said.\n\n“China and Russia have forged a new paradigm of major country relations that differs entirely from the obsolete Cold War approach on the basis of non-alliance, non-confrontation and not targeting any third party,” he added.\n\nTensions in Asia\n\nThe diplomat also addressed simmering tensions in the disputed South China Sea where non-lethal but increasingly tense clashes between Chinese and Philippine vessels in recent months have raised concerns about the risk of conflict, which could then embroil the United States, a Philippine mutual defense ally.\n\nThose flared again Tuesday when the Philippines Coast Guard accused Chinese vessels of executing “dangerous maneuvers” to impede and obstruct a resupply mission in contested waters in the South China Sea.\n\nCNN reporters were on board one of the Philippine Coast Guard vessels and witnessed how a much larger force of Chinese coast guard ships and boats from its shadowy “maritime militia” penned in a smaller convoy of Philippine vessels resupplying a remote military outpost.\n\nDespite an international tribunal rejecting China’s claim of historic rights to the bulk of the sea, it has continued to militarize islands and maintains a large presence of coast guard and fishing vessels to enforce its claims.\n\n“In the face of deliberate infringement, we will take justified actions to defend our rights in accordance with the law. In the face of unwarranted provocation, we will respond with prompt and legitimate countermeasures,” Wang said Thursday.\n\n“We also urge certain countries outside the region, not to make provocations, excite or stir up troubles,” he said, in an apparent jab at the US presence in the region.\n\nThe foreign minister’s comments on Taiwan also caught the notice of those closely watching for any evolution of Chinese policy on Taiwan during the “two sessions” meeting.\n\nChina’s ruling Communist Party claims the self-governing democracy as its territory, despite never having controlled it. It has not ruled out the use of force to retake the island, which maintains close unofficial ties with the US.\n\nSome observers had noted that a line in a report delivered by Premier Li Qiang on Tuesday proclaimed that China would advance the cause of “China’s reunification” instead of saying “peaceful reunification” as it has been written at times in the past.\n\nOn Thursday, when responding to a question about Taiwan’s recent election of Lai Ching-te, whose party views Taiwan as a de facto sovereign nation under threat from China, Wang specifically called for the support of “peaceful reunification.”\n\nHe also reiterated staid language that “whoever in the world” supports Taiwan independence will get “burned for playing with fire.”\n\nThis story has been updated.",

                        "newstext": "Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in 2019. Mark Kauzlarich | Reuters\n\nBEIJING — China's top diplomat slammed the U.S. for worsening bilateral tensions, while reiterating Beijing's support for peaceful resolutions to the Middle East and Russia-Ukraine conflicts. \"There is some progress in the China-U.S. bilateral relationship, but we have to point out that U.S. continues to persist with a wrong understanding of China and it has not fulfilled the promises it has made,\" Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters on Thursday, according to a CNBC translation of his comments in Mandarin. Wang's comments came as the U.S. Senate's homeland security committee voted Wednesday to move a bill that could limit U.S. market access for Chinese biotech firms. A member of President Joe Biden's administration also warned Wednesday that China could flood the U.S. electric-vehicle market with low-cost offerings. Biden has also doubled down on restricting Beijing's access to advanced semiconductor technology, putting a strain on U.S.-China relations that were expected to improve after Biden and President Xi Jinping met in San Francisco in November.\n\nwatch now\n\nRelations between the world's two largest economies have been characterized by their competing interests, and contrasting geopolitical positions on the Middle East and the South China Sea. Wang said the U.S. has been devising \"new ways to suppress China,\" saying U.S. accusations against China had reached an \"unbelievable degree.\" While he said he sees a way forward for both countries, Wang said communication between both countries may only continue by respecting and recognizing differences. \"The U.S. says one thing but does another, where is the trust for large countries?\" said Wang, speaking on the sidelines of the country's annual parliamentary meetings. \"If it persistently monopolizes the high end of the value chain, and keeps China at the low end, where is fairness and competition?\" he added. China's top economic objective this year is to \"modernize the industrial system and developing new quality productive forces at a faster pace\" — underscoring the heavy emphasis on strengthening Beijing's industrial prowess as a longer-term growth driver.\n\nGlobal conflicts\n\nWang is also director of the office for foreign affairs within the Communist Party of China's central commission, making him the country's most senior diplomat. After the unexplained dismissal of Qin Gang as foreign minister in July last year, Wang reassumed the role. Qin had presided over the foreign minister's press conference at last year's parliamentary meeting, but disappeared from public view within months and hasn't been seen since. Prior to reassuming the position, Wang held the foreign minister role for two terms. He has been involved with high-level U.S.-China meetings for more than a decade. Wang did not take any questions on Qin's disappearance at his press briefing.\n\nIn his press briefing though, Wang also called for a peaceful resolutions to the Middle East and Russia-Ukraine conflicts. He repeated China's calls for the resumption of Israel-Hamas peace talks and the release of all detainees, while reiterating Beijing's support for a Palestinian state. \"Palestine has a right to exist in this world ... all detainees should be released and all acts of killing should stop,\" Wang said. \"China fully supports Palestine becoming a full member of the United Nations.\" Experts have said that the absence of Palestinian statehood is the key reason why the Middle East conflict has not been resolved for decades. The U.S. in the past has vetoed resolutions aimed at recognizing a Palestinian state at the U.N. Security Council, arguing it is something to be settled with Israel directly. On the Russia-Ukraine crisis, Wang said misunderstandings and misjudgments will multiply without peace talks. He said Beijing supports a fair discussion or a solution for peace that is recognized by both sides. Russia is one of President Xi's most reliable global ally. China is willing to work with other countries to promote multi-polar economic globalization, Wang said.\n\nTaiwan and the South China Sea\n\nOn Taiwan, Wang said it's inevitable that the self-governing island will \"peacefully reunite\" with the mainland — using the phrase that was dropped from this year's China government work report. \"Taiwan's elections are merely a local election in China,\" he said. He added pro-Taiwan independence forces are the biggest factors undermining peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits. Wang said those who support Taiwan's independence will be \"burned down to the bones.\" Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party won an unprecedented third-straight presidential term at elections in January, as incoming leader Lai Ching-te pledged to stay open-minded about his approach toward governance, while committing to forging consensus in a split legislature.",

                        "newstext": "WASHINGTON, D.C. – First Lady Jill Biden will welcome guests to join her in the viewing box for President Biden’s State of the Union Address on Thursday, March 7, 2024. Each of these individuals were invited by the White House because they personify issues or themes to be addressed by the President in his speech, or they embody the Biden-Harris Administration’s policies at work for the American people. The Second Gentleman, Mr. Douglas Emhoff, will also join the First Lady in the viewing box.\n\n\n\nThe following individuals, listed in alphabetical order, will be seated in the box with the First Lady and Second Gentleman:\n\n\n\nLatorya Beasley (Birmingham, Alabama)\n\nBeasley and her husband had their first child through in vitro fertilization (IVF) in 2022 and were in the process of expanding their family through another round of IVF when her embryo transfer was abruptly canceled as a result of the recent Alabama Supreme Court decision. Her recent experience is yet another example of how the overturning of Roe v. Wade has disrupted access to reproductive health care for women and families across the country.\n\n\n\nKris Blackley (Fort Mill, South Carolina)\n\nBlackley is an oncology nurse and the Director of Patient Navigation for the Atrium Health Levine Cancer Institute, part of Advocate Health. She has published research related to patient navigation showing improved outcomes, including decreased readmissions, increased treatment compliance, and equity in care. In 2023, the Biden Cancer Moonshot announced new actions to expand access to patient navigation services — services that help guide individuals, caregivers, and families through cancer screening, diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship. In February 2023, the First Lady visited Atrium Health, where Blackley shared how the health system plans to bring patient navigation services to more cancer patients and their loved ones as a result of the Biden-Harris Administration’s actions.\n\n\n\nJazmin Cazares (Uvalde, Texas)\n\nCazares is a leading advocate for gun violence prevention at the state and national level. After her sister Jackie was killed in the shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas, Cazares spent her senior year of high school traveling across the country and sharing Jackie’s story. She spoke alongside March for Our Lives leaders at the Texas State Capitol and testified before lawmakers to advocate for tighter background checks and extreme risk protection order laws. In 2023, Cazares was honored by the First Lady during the first-ever “Girls Leading Change” celebration at the White House.\n\n\n\nKate Cox (Dallas, Texas)\n\nCox is a mother of two from Texas who has experienced the devastating consequences of state abortion bans and courageously spoke out about her experience seeking the care she needed to preserve her health. Cox is one of the first women in 50 years to have to turn to the courts to ask permission to receive the abortion that her doctor recommended. She was ultimately forced to travel out of state for care that she would have been able to receive if the protections of Roe v. Wade were still in effect.\n\n\n\nSamantha Ervin-Upsher (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)\n\nErvin-Upsher is an apprentice with the United Brotherhood of Carpenters Local 432 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She is 23 years old and a mother of two. In 2023, Ervin-Upsher met the First Lady during a visit to Pennsylvania to highlight the Investing in America Workforce Hub in Pittsburgh, an initiative that seeks to build career pathways through high schools, community colleges, and unions to job opportunities fueled by President’s Biden’s investments.\n\n\n\nShawn Fain (Metro Detroit, Michigan)\n\nFain is a 29-year member and the current President of the United Auto Workers (UAW). Hailing from a family of UAW members, Fain got his start with UAW Local Union 1166 as an electrician for Chrysler at the Kokomo Casting Plant in his hometown of Kokomo, Indiana. In September 2023, President Biden joined Fain and UAW workers on the picket line in Belleville, Michigan, making history as the first sitting President to join a picket line. After hard-fought negotiations and a “Stand-Up” strike that inspired workers across the country, the UAW won historic pay increases, greater retirement security, more paid leave, and more dignity and respect. Their efforts also yielded job security commitments from General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis, including a commitment from Stellantis to bring thousands of good-paying UAW jobs back to Belvidere, Illinois. The UAW’s historic contract immediately led non-union automakers to announce double digit pay raises for their U.S. workers – adding further evidence that when unions do well, all workers do well.\n\n\n\nBettie Mae Fikes (Selma, Alabama)\n\nFikes is an American singer and civil rights advocate who was a Bloody Sunday Foot Soldier in Selma, Alabama in 1965. Known as “The Voice of Selma,” Fikes served as a member of Selma’s Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) Freedom Singers. She has performed at Carnegie Hall, Newport Jazz Festival, the Library of Congress, and was featured in the Smithsonian Institute’s Museum of Tolerance exhibition honoring women of the Civil Rights Movement. In 2023, Fikes joined President Biden to commemorate the 58th anniversary of Bloody Sunday in Selma, Alabama. This year’s State of the Union Address falls on the 59th anniversary of Bloody Sunday.\n\n\n\nSteven Hadfield (Matthews, North Carolina)\n\nHadfield has a rare blood cancer and is diabetic—two conditions that require very expensive drugs, including a drug that was selected for the first round of Medicare drug price negotiation. He held several part-time positions because he feared that, if he retired, he would not have sufficient income to pay for the drugs he needs to stay alive. The drug that treats his rare blood cancer costs about $15,000 a month. On top of that, his insulin costs him up to $400 every month. Now, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, Medicare covers his insulin prescriptions with a $35 copay cap per month. And for his blood cancer medications, this year, his Part D out-of-pocket drug costs are capped at about $3,500 and in 2025, he will benefit even more from the $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket drug costs.\n\n\n\nMayor Garnett L. Johnson (Augusta, Georgia)\n\nJohnson is the Mayor of the City of Augusta, Georgia. In 2023, Augusta was designated by the White House as one of five Investing in America Workforce Hubs, where President Biden’s agenda — including the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act — is driving historic investments and creating good-paying jobs. The Augusta Workforce Hub is led by a partnership between Mayor Johnson and three Augusta regional education institutions focused on training students in growing sectors, such as advanced manufacturing and construction skilled trades, to prepare the next generation for technical jobs in the region. The First Lady was last in Augusta in July and November 2023, to meet with Mayor Johnson and highlight how the local community is working together to expand pathways to careers.\n\n\n\nKeenan Jones (Plymouth, Minnesota)\n\nJones is a public middle school educator in Minnesota’s Twin Cities and a member of Education Minnesota. In April 2023, Jones wrote an email to President Biden to thank him for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which eliminated his remaining student loan debt after 10 years of public service and allowed him to continue his teaching career. Jones is one of the nearly 800,000 teachers, nurses, social workers, servicemembers, and other public servants who have received student loan debt forgiveness since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration.\n\n\n\nNatalie King (Detroit, Michigan)\n\nKing is the founder and CEO of Dunamis Charge, the first-ever African American women-owned electric vehicle charger manufacturing company in the United States. Her company employs over 135 workers and is on track to manufacture 400,000 electric vehicle chargers by 2025.

Sweden is formally joining the NATO Alliance on March 7, 2024, becoming the 32nd Ally. Sweden is a strong democracy with a highly capable military that shares our values and vision for the world. Having Sweden as a NATO Ally will make the United States and our Allies even safer. NATO is the most powerful defensive alliance in the history of the world, and it is as critical today to ensuring the security of our citizens as it was 75 years ago when our Alliance was founded out of the wreckage of World War II.\n\n\n\nGovernor Stephen Roe Lewis (Gu-u-Ki, Sacaton, Arizona)\n\nLewis is serving in his fourth term as governor of the Gila River Indian Community. Under his leadership, he has prioritized bringing innovative solutions to long-term issues confronted by the Community and Indian Country. In partnership with the Biden-Harris Administration, Governor Lewis has revolutionized how Tribal governmental infrastructure is constructed, which led to the completion of the first new schools on the Reservation in over 100 years and the first solar-over-canal project in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n\n\nCommander Shelby Nikitin (Wakefield, Massachusetts)\n\nCommander Nikitin is an officer in the U.S. Navy and recently completed her command tour onboard the USS THOMAS HUDNER.

Since starting Overdose Lifeline, Phillips has led the organization through program expansion to meet the growing needs of the population. Phillips worked to pass “Aaron’s Law” in Indiana and focuses her advocacy on expanding access to overdose prevention medications. Aaron’s Law allows individuals access to Narcan without a prescription, thus eliminating barriers to receiving the drug and using it to save lives. The Second Gentleman met Phillips and her daughter, Audrey, in 2023 at an event commemorating International Overdose Awareness Day, where the Administration announced additional federal funds to combat accidental overdoses. Phillips is a special guest of Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff.\n\n\n\nKameryn Pupunu (Lahaina, Hawaii)\n\nPupunu is a police officer for the county of Maui where he has served for the last five years. In August 2023, his hometown of Lahaina was engulfed in flames during one of the deadliest wildfires in U.S history. Pupunu was one of the many local police officers who performed heroic acts, including saving 15 individuals, from this deadly wildfire. Tragically, Pupunu lost four of his immediate family members to these fires.\n\n\n\nMaria Shriver (Los Angeles, California)\n\nShriver is an author, journalist, and founder of the Women’s Alzheimer’s Movement and Strategic Advisor on Women’s Health and Alzheimer’s at Cleveland Clinic.

Shriver’s advocacy has been integral to the initiative and she continues to advise and collaborate with Dr. Biden.\n\n\n\nDawn Simms (Davis Junction, Illinois)\n\nSimms has been a member of the United Auto Workers (UAW) Local 1268 for more than two decades. She’s a third-generation autoworker on at Belvidere Assembly (IL), where she started work in 1999. When Stellantis idled Belvidere Assembly in February 2023, Simms’ son was in the middle of his sophomore year in high school and forced her into an impossible decision: lose her job or relocate to another plant far away from her home (and either move her son or leave him in Illinois). Thanks to the strength and the solidarity of the UAW members, the UAW-Big Three contract secured a commitment from Stellantis to reopen Belvidere Assembly and bring thousands of good-paying middle-class jobs back to Belvidere, stabilizing her family’s future. Today, she is gainfully employed at Stellantis’ auto distribution center in Belvidere. In November 2023, Simms joined President Biden in Belvidere to highlight the reopening of the assembly plant and the return of thousands of good-paying UAW jobs.\n\n\n\nRashawn Spivey (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)\n\nSpivey is the founder and owner of Hero Plumbing in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His decision to become a plumber was inspired by his mother, who worked for one of the first Black-owned plumbing businesses in Wisconsin. After graduating from a plumbing program at Milwaukee Area Technical College and completing an apprenticeship with Plumbers Local 75, support from his local union enabled Spivey to launch his own plumbing business. Spurred by investments from the Biden-Harris Administration, Spivey expanded his plumbing business to focus on lead pipe replacements. Spivey and his team have replaced more than 825 toxic lead pipes, primarily at local daycare centers, to ensure safer drinking water for his community and protect children from lead poisoning. Through historic levels of funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the American Rescue Plan, the Biden-Harris Administration is working to replace every lead pipe in America in the next decade.\n\n\n\nTiffany Zoeller (Fayetteville, North Carolina)\n\nZoeller is a military spouse and works as a medical coder at Fort Liberty’s Womack Army Medical Center. In June 2023, Zoeller introduced the President at Fort Liberty to announce the Presidential Executive Order on Advancing Economic Security for Military and Veteran Spouses, Military Caregivers, and Survivors. This Executive Order is the most comprehensive set of administrative actions any President has ever taken to support military spouses, and included nearly 20 new actions aimed at enhancing military spouse career stability, employment resources, and career transition assistance. The First Lady, through her Joining Forces initiative, has worked to eliminate barriers to employment and increase economic opportunity for military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors.\n\n###",

                        "article_html": "<div><p><strong>WASHINGTON, D.C.</strong> &#8211; First Lady Jill Biden will welcome guests to join her in the viewing box for President Biden&#8217;s State of the Union Address on Thursday, March 7, 2024. Each of these individuals were invited by the White House because they personify issues or themes to be addressed by the President in his speech, or they embody the Biden-Harris Administration&#8217;s policies at work for the American people. The Second Gentleman, Mr. Douglas Emhoff, will also join the First Lady in the viewing box.<br>&#160;<br>The following individuals, listed in alphabetical order, will be seated in the box with the First Lady and Second Gentleman:<br>&#160;<br><strong>Latorya Beasley (Birmingham, Alabama)</strong><br>Beasley and her husband had their first child through in vitro fertilization (IVF) in 2022 and were in the process of expanding their family through another round of IVF when her embryo transfer was abruptly canceled as a result of the recent Alabama Supreme Court decision. Her recent experience is yet another example of how the overturning of Roe v. Wade has disrupted access to reproductive health care for women and families across the country.<br>&#160;<br><strong>Kris Blackley (Fort Mill, South Carolina)</strong><br>Blackley is an oncology nurse and the Director of Patient Navigation for the Atrium Health Levine Cancer Institute, part of Advocate Health. She has published research related to patient navigation showing improved outcomes, including decreased readmissions, increased treatment compliance, and equity in care. In 2023, the Biden Cancer Moonshot announced new actions to expand access to patient navigation services &#8212; services that help guide individuals, caregivers, and families through cancer screening, diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship. In February 2023, the First Lady visited Atrium Health, where Blackley shared how the health system plans to bring patient navigation services to more cancer patients and their loved ones as a result of the Biden-Harris Administration&#8217;s actions.<br>&#160;<br><strong>Jazmin Cazares (Uvalde, Texas)</strong><br>Cazares is a leading advocate for gun violence prevention at the state and national level. After her sister Jackie was killed in the shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas, Cazares spent her senior year of high school traveling across the country and sharing Jackie&#8217;s story. She spoke alongside March for Our Lives leaders at the Texas State Capitol and testified before lawmakers to advocate for tighter background checks and extreme risk protection order laws. In 2023, Cazares was honored by the First Lady during the first-ever &#8220;Girls Leading Change&#8221; celebration at the White House.<br>&#160;<br><strong>Kate Cox (Dallas, Texas)</strong><br>Cox is a mother of two from Texas who has experienced the devastating consequences of state abortion bans and courageously spoke out about her experience seeking the care she needed to preserve her health. Cox is one of the first women in 50 years to have to turn to the courts to ask permission to receive the abortion that her doctor recommended. She was ultimately forced to travel out of state for care that she would have been able to receive if the protections of Roe v. Wade were still in effect.&#160;<br>&#160;<br><strong>Samantha Ervin-Upsher (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)</strong><br>Ervin-Upsher is an apprentice with the United Brotherhood of Carpenters Local 432 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She is 23 years old and a mother of two. In 2023, Ervin-Upsher met the First Lady during a visit to Pennsylvania to highlight the Investing in America Workforce Hub in Pittsburgh, an initiative that seeks to build career pathways through high schools, community colleges, and unions to job opportunities fueled by President&#8217;s Biden&#8217;s investments.<br>&#160;<br><strong>Shawn Fain (Metro Detroit, Michigan)&#160;</strong><br>Fain is a 29-year member and the current President of the United Auto Workers (UAW). Hailing from a family of UAW members, Fain got his start with UAW Local Union 1166 as an electrician for Chrysler at the Kokomo Casting Plant in his hometown of Kokomo, Indiana. In September 2023, President Biden joined Fain and UAW workers on the picket line in Belleville, Michigan, making history as the first sitting President to join a picket line. After hard-fought negotiations and a &#8220;Stand-Up&#8221; strike that inspired workers across the country, the UAW won historic pay increases, greater retirement security, more paid leave, and more dignity and respect. Their efforts also yielded job security commitments from General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis, including a commitment from Stellantis to bring thousands of good-paying UAW jobs back to Belvidere, Illinois. The UAW&#8217;s historic contract immediately led non-union automakers to announce double digit pay raises for their U.S. workers &#8211; adding further evidence that when unions do well, all workers do well.<br>&#160;<br><strong>Bettie Mae Fikes (Selma, Alabama)</strong><br>Fikes is an American singer and civil rights advocate who was a Bloody Sunday Foot Soldier in Selma, Alabama in 1965. Known as &#8220;The Voice of Selma,&#8221; Fikes served as a member of Selma&#8217;s Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) Freedom Singers. She has performed at Carnegie Hall, Newport Jazz Festival, the Library of Congress, and was featured in the Smithsonian Institute&#8217;s Museum of Tolerance exhibition honoring women of the Civil Rights Movement. In 2023, Fikes joined President Biden to commemorate the 58th anniversary of Bloody Sunday in Selma, Alabama. This year&#8217;s State of the Union Address falls on the 59th anniversary of Bloody Sunday.<br>&#160;<br><strong>Steven Hadfield (Matthews, North Carolina)</strong><br>Hadfield has a rare blood cancer and is diabetic&#8212;two conditions that require very expensive drugs, including a drug that was selected for the first round of Medicare drug price negotiation. He held several part-time positions because he feared that, if he retired, he would not have sufficient income to pay for the drugs he needs to stay alive. The drug that treats his rare blood cancer costs about $15,000 a month. On top of that, his insulin costs him up to $400 every month. Now, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, Medicare covers his insulin prescriptions with a $35 copay cap per month. And for his blood cancer medications, this year, his Part D out-of-pocket drug costs are capped at about $3,500 and in 2025, he will benefit even more from the $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket drug costs.<br>&#160;<br><strong>Mayor Garnett L. Johnson (Augusta, Georgia)</strong><br>Johnson is the Mayor of the City of Augusta, Georgia. In 2023, Augusta was designated by the White House as one of five Investing in America Workforce Hubs, where President Biden&#8217;s agenda &#8212; including the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act &#8212; is driving historic investments and creating good-paying jobs. The Augusta Workforce Hub is led by a partnership between Mayor Johnson and three Augusta regional education institutions focused on training students in growing sectors, such as advanced manufacturing and construction skilled trades, to prepare the next generation for technical jobs in the region. The First Lady was last in Augusta in July and November 2023, to meet with Mayor Johnson and highlight how the local community is working together to expand pathways to careers.&#160;<br>&#160;<br><strong>Keenan Jones (Plymouth, Minnesota)</strong><br>Jones is a public middle school educator in Minnesota&#8217;s Twin Cities and a member of Education Minnesota. In April 2023, Jones wrote an email to President Biden to thank him for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which eliminated his remaining student loan debt after 10 years of public service and allowed him to continue his teaching career. Jones is one of the nearly 800,000 teachers, nurses, social workers, servicemembers, and other public servants who have received student loan debt forgiveness since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration.<br>&#160;<br><strong>Natalie King (Detroit, Michigan)</strong><br>King is the founder and CEO of Dunamis Charge, the first-ever African American women-owned electric vehicle charger manufacturing company in the United States.

She was taken into custody ahead of her sentencing, which is not expected until next month.\n\nA jury convicted armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed on Wednesday of involuntary manslaughter relating to the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of the film \"Rust\" in 2021.\n\nActor Alec Baldwin, a producer and actor on the film, was holding a Colt .45 during rehearsals for the low-budget Western in New Mexico when it discharged a live round, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza.\n\nGutierrez-Reed was supposed to load Baldwin's revolver with dummy rounds, but one round was live.\n\nThe involuntary manslaughter charge against Gutierrez-Reed carries a maximum penalty of 18 months in prison and a $5,000 fine.\n\nGutierrez-Reed cleared of evidence tampering\n\nThe jury in New Mexico took just three hours to reach their decision following ten days of testimony.\n\nHowever, they acquitted Gutierrez-Reed on a second charge of evidence tampering.\n\nThe trial had focused on whether the inexperienced armorer endangered fellow crew and cast members in her handling and supervision of firearms on set.\n\nAfter the verdict, Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer remanded Gutierrez-Reed in custody before her sentencing, which is not expected before next month.\n\nHer attorney, Jason Bowles, said afterward that Gutierrez-Reed would appeal the conviction.\n\nActor Alec Baldwin to be charged in 'Rust' set death To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nWhat led to the fatal shooting?\n\nProsecutors said earlier at trial that Gutierrez-Reed unknowingly loaded live ammunition into a reproduction Colt .45 revolver that Baldwin was using on the set at a ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe.\n\nThe prosecution alleged that Gutierrez-Reed unwittingly carried live ammunition onto the set of \"Rust,\" asserting that the rounds remained undetected for a minimum of 12 days leading up to the tragic shooting incident.\n\nThey contended she repeatedly skipped or skimped on standard gun safety protocols that might have detected the live rounds.\n\n\"This case is about constant, never-ending safety failures that resulted in the death of a human being and nearly killed another,\" said New Mexico state special prosecutor Kari Morrissey in her closing statements earlier Wednesday.\n\nNew Mexico's worker safety agency in 2022 fined the company, Rust Media Productions, the state's maximum possible penalty for ignoring industry firearm safety guidelines.\n\nBaldwin facing own trial over involuntary manslaughter\n\nAlec Baldwin remused filming \"Rust\" in April 2023 and concluded in May 2023 Image: Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office/ZUMAPRESS/picture alliance\n\nBaldwin pleaded not guilty to his own involuntary manslaughter charge in February after being indicted by a grand jury on January 19, 2024.\n\nThe US actor has repeatedly denied responsibility for the shooting, insisting that he did not pull the trigger of the gun.\n\nBaldwin was originally charged with the shooting in January 2023 but those charges were dropped a few months later with evidence showing the revolver's hammer might have been modified to enable it to fire without someone pulling the trigger.\n\nHowever, new charges were filed after an independent forensic test concluded that Baldwin would have needed to pull the trigger of the revolved he was using during the rehearsal in order for it to fire the live round that killed Hutchins.\n\nHis trial is expected in July.\n\nkm/lo (AP, AFP, Reuters)",

                        "newstext": "Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the armorer on the ill-fated Western film “Rust,” was convicted on Wednesday of involuntary manslaughter in the death of the film’s cinematographer.\n\nJurors returned a verdict after less than three hours of deliberations on Wednesday afternoon, following two weeks of testimony about safety lapses on set.\n\nGutierrez Reed was acquitted of a separate charge of tampering with evidence. She faces up to 18 months in prison at sentencing, which is expected sometime in April.\n\nFollowing the verdict, Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer ordered Gutierrez Reed remanded into custody. As her attorney, Monnica Barreras, rubbed her back to comfort her, bailiffs led her away.\n\nOutside the First Judicial District courthouse in Santa Fe, N.M., juror Alberto Sanchez told reporters that the jury reached a “fair” verdict.\n\n“Someone died,” Sanchez said. “You gotta take responsibility. Especially when you’re handling weapons and you’re in charge of those. That’s your job.”\n\nGutierrez Reed was the first person to stand trial in the Oct. 21, 2021, shooting on the film set at the Bonanza Creek Ranch outside Santa Fe, N.M.\n\nAlec Baldwin is set to face his own manslaughter trial in July. The first assistant director, Dave Halls, took a plea deal last year to a misdemeanor count of negligent handling of a gun, and served six months of unsupervised probation.\n\nGutierrez Reed loaded a live bullet into Baldwin’s pistol, which should have contained only dummy rounds. The gun fired, killing Halyna Hutchins and seriously wounding director Joel Souza.\n\nGutierrez Reed got the job largely because her father, Thell Reed, is a legendary film armorer who worked on “Tombstone,” “3:10 to Yuma,” and “L.A. Confidential,” among many others.\n\nThell Reed was in the courtroom when the verdict was read. Though his name was on the defense witness list, he was not called to testify. Stacy Reed, the defendant’s mother, was also there, and was in tears when her daughter was led away.\n\nStacy Reed, mother of Hannah Gutierrez Reed, reacts after hearing the guilty verdict during her daughter’s trial at district court on Wednesday, Mar. 6, 2024. Luis Sánchez Saturno/The New Mexican\n\nRachel Mason, a friend of Hutchins’, attended the trial, and is directing and producing a documentary about her life entitled “Halyna.” Interviewed after the verdict, Mason said she was still processing feelings of grief and mourning.\n\n“My overall feeling is extreme sadness that Halyna will continue to not be here,” Mason said. “Hannah going to jail will not change that.”\n\nTo convict on the involuntary manslaughter charge, jurors had to agree that Gutierrez Reed acted with “willful disregard for the safety of others” and that the death was a “foreseeable” consequence of her actions.\n\nShortly before the verdict, the jurors asked a question about what might constitute an “intervening event” that would break the foreseeable chain of events. Marlowe Sommer said that she could not offer further explanation than what was contained in jury instructions.\n\nIn her closing argument on Wednesday morning, prosecutor Kari Morrissey argued that Gutierrez Reed’s actions constituted an “astonishing” failure to adhere to industry safety practices. She argued that Gutierrez Reed was responsible for bringing the live rounds to set, and that she never properly rattle-tested them to ensure they were dummies.\n\nThe jury appeared to agree with that assessment.\n\n“She could have paused work, stopped, and cleared it all up, and just never did,” Sanchez said outside the courthouse. “That was her job to check those rounds — those firearms. No one wanted to pay attention or do that sort of stuff and stop work.”\n\nDefense attorney Jason Bowles countered that a workplace safety investigation laid the blame on management, in part for failing to give Gutierrez Reed adequate time to do her job. He also sought to put blame onto Seth Kenney, the weapons supplier who provided blanks and dummy rounds to the production.\n\nOutside court, Bowles said was disappointed with the verdict and would appeal.\n\n“The evidence wasn’t sufficient to convict,” he said. “It was a lot of guesswork, a lot of speculation.”\n\nMary Carmack-Altwies, the elected district attorney in Santa Fe, issued a statement Wednesday afternoon thanking the jury and thanking Morrissey and Jason Lewis, the outside attorneys whom she appointed as special prosecutors on the case.\n\n“From the outset of this case, the FJDA’s sole pursuits were to bring justice to Halyna Hutchins’ family and friends and to ensure that those responsible for her death were held accountable,” Carmack-Altwies said. “In order to do so, the prosecution team exhausted investigative efforts which proved pivotal to successfully moving forward with this tragic and entirely preventable case.”\n\nMorrissey and Lewis took over the case last March, after Carmack-Altwies and another special prosecutor withdrew.\n\nThe two private attorneys hired a new firearms expert and an imaging expert to enhance photographs. They subpoenaed behind-the-scenes footage, and conducted an exhaustive review of thousands of photos and videos, ultimately concluding that Gutierrez Reed had brought the live rounds to the film set.\n\nSanchez said the jury agreed with that conclusion.\n\nGloria Allred, who has sued Baldwin and the “Rust” producers on behalf of Hutchins’ parents and sister, issued a statement saying she is “satisfied” with the verdict, but that her clients wish for everyone responsible to be held to account.\n\n“Today was the first trial and conviction in the criminal justice process,” Allred and co-counsel John Carpenter said in the statement. “We look forward to the justice system continuing to make sure that everyone else who is responsible for Halyna’s death is required to face the legal consequences for their actions.”",

                        "newstext": "Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the armorer on the ill-fated Western film “Rust,” was convicted on Wednesday of involuntary manslaughter in the death of the film’s cinematographer.\n\nJurors returned a verdict after less than three hours of deliberations on Wednesday afternoon, following two weeks of testimony about safety lapses on set.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nGutierrez Reed was acquitted of a separate charge of tampering with evidence. She faces up to 18 months in prison at sentencing, which is expected sometime in April.\n\nFollowing the verdict, Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer ordered Gutierrez Reed remanded into custody. As her attorney, Monnica Barreras, rubbed her back to comfort her, bailiffs led her away.\n\nOutside the First Judicial District courthouse in Santa Fe, N.M., juror Alberto Sanchez told reporters that the jury reached a “fair” verdict.\n\n“Someone died,” Sanchez said. “You gotta take responsibility. Especially when you’re handling weapons and you’re in charge of those. That’s your job.”\n\nGutierrez Reed was the first person to stand trial in the Oct. 21, 2021, shooting on the film set at the Bonanza Creek Ranch outside Santa Fe, N.M.\n\nAlec Baldwin is set to face his own manslaughter trial in July. The first assistant director, Dave Halls, took a plea deal last year to a misdemeanor count of negligent handling of a gun, and served six months of unsupervised probation.\n\nGutierrez Reed loaded a live bullet into Baldwin’s pistol, which should have contained only dummy rounds. The gun fired, killing Halyna Hutchins and seriously wounding director Joel Souza.\n\nGutierrez Reed got the job largely because her father, Thell Reed, is a legendary film armorer who worked on “Tombstone,” “3:10 to Yuma,” and “L.A. Confidential,” among many others.\n\nThell Reed was in the courtroom when the verdict was read. Though his name was on the defense witness list, he was not called to testify. Stacy Reed, the defendant’s mother, was also there, and was in tears when her daughter was led away.\n\nStacy Reed, mother of Hannah Gutierrez Reed, reacts after hearing the guilty verdict during her daughter’s trial at district court on Wednesday, Mar. 6, 2024.\n\nRachel Mason, a friend of Hutchins’, attended the trial, and is directing and producing a documentary about her life entitled “Halyna.” Interviewed after the verdict, Mason said she was still processing feelings of grief and mourning.\n\n“My overall feeling is extreme sadness that Halyna will continue to not be here,” Mason said. “Hannah going to jail will not change that.”\n\nTo convict on the involuntary manslaughter charge, jurors had to agree that Gutierrez Reed acted with “willful disregard for the safety of others” and that the death was a “foreseeable” consequence of her actions.\n\nShortly before the verdict, the jurors asked a question about what might constitute an “intervening event” that would break the foreseeable chain of events. Marlowe Sommer said that she could not offer further explanation than what was contained in jury instructions.\n\nIn her closing argument on Wednesday morning, prosecutor Kari Morrissey argued that Gutierrez Reed’s actions constituted an “astonishing” failure to adhere to industry safety practices. She argued that Gutierrez Reed was responsible for bringing the live rounds to set, and that she never properly rattle-tested them to ensure they were dummies.\n\nThe jury appeared to agree with that assessment.\n\n“She could have paused work, stopped, and cleared it all up, and just never did,” Sanchez said outside the courthouse. “That was her job to check those rounds — those firearms. No one wanted to pay attention or do that sort of stuff and stop work.”\n\nDefense attorney Jason Bowles countered that a workplace safety investigation laid the blame on management, in part for failing to give Gutierrez Reed adequate time to do her job. He also sought to put blame onto Seth Kenney, the weapons supplier who provided blanks and dummy rounds to the production.\n\nOutside court, Bowles said was disappointed with the verdict and would appeal.\n\n“The evidence wasn’t sufficient to convict,” he said. “It was a lot of guesswork, a lot of speculation.”\n\nMary Carmack-Altwies, the elected district attorney in Santa Fe, issued a statement Wednesday afternoon thanking the jury and thanking Morrissey and Jason Lewis, the outside attorneys whom she appointed as special prosecutors on the case.\n\n“From the outset of this case, the FJDA’s sole pursuits were to bring justice to Halyna Hutchins’ family and friends and to ensure that those responsible for her death were held accountable,” Carmack-Altwies said. “In order to do so, the prosecution team exhausted investigative efforts which proved pivotal to successfully moving forward with this tragic and entirely preventable case.”\n\nMorrissey and Lewis took over the case last March, after Carmack-Altwies and another special prosecutor withdrew.\n\nThe two private attorneys hired a new firearms expert and an imaging expert to enhance photographs. They subpoenaed behind-the-scenes footage, and conducted an exhaustive review of thousands of photos and videos, ultimately concluding that Gutierrez Reed had brought the live rounds to the film set.\n\nSanchez said the jury agreed with that conclusion.\n\nGloria Allred, who has sued Baldwin and the “Rust” producers on behalf of Hutchins’ parents and sister, issued a statement saying she is “satisfied” with the verdict, but that her clients wish for everyone responsible to be held to account.\n\n“Today was the first trial and conviction in the criminal justice process,” Allred and co-counsel John Carpenter said in the statement. “We look forward to the justice system continuing to make sure that everyone else who is responsible for Halyna’s death is required to face the legal consequences for their actions.”\n\nBest of Variety\n\nSign up for Variety’s Newsletter.

That could be a positive signal that Fed officials are not overly concerned by the price spike.\n\nResponding to questions from committee members, Powell added, \"because the economy has been so strong we think we can and should be careful\" about slicing rates. He added the Fed wants \"to see more good inflation readings\" to feel confident that the recent pullback in price gains won't stall or reverse.\n\n'Losing my mind'Behind the gaudy job numbers, Americans are struggling to find work\n\nWhat is the inflation rate in 2024?\n\nIn January, inflation overall rose 0.3% while a core measure that excludes volatile food and energy items increased 0.4%, both substantially higher than the recent trend, according to the personal consumption expenditures index, the Fed’s preferred gauge.\n\nBut those readings still pushed down annual inflation to 2.4% and the core yearly measure to 2.8%. Personal consumption expenditures inflation peaked at a 40-year high of 7% in June 2022.\n\nOn Wednesday, Powell said the risks of cutting rates too soon versus waiting too long have become more balanced now that inflation has moderated.\n\n“Reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of progress we have seen in inflation and ultimately require tighter policy to get inflation back to 2%,” Powell said in his prepared testimony. “At the same time reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.”\n\nWhat are interest rates today?\n\nFutures markets now predict the Fed will start lowering its benchmark rate in June and trim it by a quarter percentage point four times, from a 22-year high of 5.25% to 5.5% to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%. From March 2022 to July 2023, the Fed hoisted its federal funds rate from near zero to wrestle down inflation.\n\nWill home interest rates go down in 2024?\n\nLowering the Fed’s key short-term rate would reduce borrowing costs for mortgages, credit cards, auto loans and other types of consumer and business loans, though it would also trim bank savings rates that finally have delivered healthy yields after years of meager returns. The prospect of Fed rate cuts has propelled the stock market to record highs.\n\nWith inflation slowing, the Fed has held its key rate steady for four straight meetings since July. And late last year, Fed officials forecast three rate cuts this year.\n\nIn his testimony, Powell noted that the economy and job market have continued to grow solidly. The economy grew 3.1% from the fourth quarter of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2023 and monthly job growth has averaged 239,000 since the middle of last year, Powell said.\n\nIs there going to be a recession in 2024?\n\nPowell said the Fed is on track to achieve a “soft landing” in which it tames inflation without tipping the economy into recession.\n\n“There’s no reason to think the U.S. economy is… at risk of falling into recession,” Powell said, noting that growth has continued “at a solid pace.”\n\nBut he added that officials won’t announce at any point that the nation has dodged a downturn. “We’re just going to keep our head down and do our job,” Powell said. “We won’t be declaring victory.”\n\nHe also largely dismissed suggestions that the Fed should raise its inflation goal above 2%, as some countries have done.\n\nNoting overall inflation is at 2.4%, he said, “There’s no reason to think it's a problem for the United States to get to 2% inflation.”\n\nPaul Davidson writes about the economy for USA TODAY.",

                        "newstext": "NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are climbing Thursday, helping Wall Street erase its losses from earlier in the week.\n\nThe S&P 500 was 1% higher in afternoon trading and back above its record close set last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 138 points, or 0.4%, as of 12:24 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.4% higher.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is testifying again on Capitol Hill about interest-rate policy, and he’s echoing what he said a day before: The Federal Reserve’s next move on interest rates is likely a cut, but it first needs to see additional data showing inflation is cooling.\n\nAfter getting criticism for waiting too long before raising interest rates when inflation was accelerating, Powell faced questions from the Senate banking committee about the possibility that it could be too late in cutting rates. That would cause undue pain because high rates slow the economy.\n\n“We’re well aware of that risk, of course,” Powell said. He said if conditions continue as expected, including a strong job market and cooling inflation, cuts will come later this year. Cutting rates too early could risk a reacceleration of inflation.\n\nIt’s a key point on Wall Street because cuts to rates would release pressure on the economy and the financial system. After shelving earlier forecasts for cuts to begin in March, traders now see June as the likeliest starting point. The Fed’s main interest rate is at its highest level since 2001.\n\nTreasury yields were relatively steady in the bond market after a couple reports gave potential signals of lessened pressure on inflation, which could help convince the Fed it’s heading toward rate cuts.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury held steady at 4.11%, from late Wednesday. It’s been generally falling since topping 5% last autumn, which can encourage borrowing across the economy and investors to pay higher prices for stocks.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, traders were also trying to guess when the European Central Bank will begin cutting interest rates after its president said it’s making progress on getting inflation under control.\n\nOne report said slightly more U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than expected, though the number remains low relative to history.\n\nA separate report said U.S. workers were able to produce more stuff per hour during the last three months of 2023 than expected. Such improvement is key because it can allow the economy to grow without adding as much upward pressure on inflation.\n\nA potentially more impactful report will arrive Friday, when the U.S. government will give its latest monthly update on the job market. The hope among traders is that the job market remains healthy but not so much that it deters the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates.\n\nOn Wall Street, Kroger jumped 8.6% for one of the biggest gains in the S&P 500 after it reported stronger-than-expected profit for the end of 2023. It also gave a forecast range for profit in the upcoming year whose midpoint was above analysts’ estimates.\n\nNvidia was again the strongest force lifting the S&P 500 upward and up 3.4%. It’s been on a nearly unstoppable run and has soared 85% this year after more than tripling last year amid Wall Street’s frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology.\n\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters rose 2.2% after reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The retailer also unveiled a plan to kickstarts growth in operating profit.\n\nVictoria’s Secret was on the losing end even after it also reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected. It said it expects overall sales to fall this upcoming year, when analysts were looking for modest growth. It tumbled 30.2%.\n\nShares of embattled New York Community Bancorp were 6.9% higher a day after going on a wild ride. The bank, which is battling weakness in commercial real estate and growing pains resulting from its buyout of a distressed bank, announced a lifeline of more than $1 billion from a group of investors on Wednesday.\n\nThe bank is also cutting its dividend again, down to a penny from 5 cents. A prior cut to its dividend earlier this year, along with a surprise loss reported for its latest quarter, drove much of the fear around NYCB. The bank also said it has $77.2 billion in total deposits, down from $83 billion roughly a month ago.\n\nAnalysts are still saying NYCB’s problems are specific to it, rather than a warning of impending doom for the broader industry, but stocks of other regional banks have been skittish. The KBW Nasdaq Regional Banking index rose 0.1%.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes were higher in Europe after the European Central Bank left its main interest rate alone. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index briefly reached a record before falling to a loss of 1.2%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed.",

Read more about how we evaluate products.\n\nIt's hard to expect much from Apple's new M3-equipped MacBook Airs. The 13-inch M2 model, released in 2022, was the first major redesign for Apple's most popular notebook in over a decade. Last year, Apple finally gave its fanatics a big-screen ultraportable notebook with the 15-inch MacBook Air. This week, we've got the same two computers with slightly faster chips. They didn't even get a real launch event from Apple, just a sleepy Monday morning press release. They look the same and are a bit faster than before — what else is there to say?\n\nNow, I'm not saying these aren't great computers. It's just that we've been a bit spoiled by Apple's laptops over the last few years. The M3 MacBook Air marks the inevitable innovation plateau for the company, following the monumental rise of its mobile chips and a complete refresh of its laptops and desktops. It's like hitting cruising altitude after the excitement of takeoff — things are stable and comfortable for Apple and consumers alike.\n\nApple 90 100 13-inch MacBook Air (M3) Apple's latest MacBook Air takes everything we loved about the M2 redesign — a sleeker and lighter case — and adds more power thanks to an M3 chip. Pros Sturdy and sleek design\n\nFast performance thanks to M3 chip\n\nExcellent 13-inch screen\n\nGreat keyboard and trackpad\n\nSolid quad-speaker array Cons Charging and USB-C ports are only on one side $1,099 at Amazon\n\nApple 90 100 15-inch MacBook Air (M3) Apple's big-screen MacBook Air still looks and feels great, and it's faster thanks to an M3 chip. Pros Sturdy and sleek design\n\nFast performance thanks to M3 chip\n\nExcellent 15-inch screen\n\nGreat keyboard and trackpad\n\nSolid six-speaker array Cons Charging and USB-C ports are only on one side $1,299 at Amazon\n\nM3 MacBook Air vs the M2 MacBook Air\n\nEven though they look exactly the same as before, the M3 MacBook Air models have a few new features under the hood. For one, they support dual external displays, but only when their lids are closed. That was something even the M3-equipped 14-inch MacBook Pro lacked at launch, but Apple says the feature is coming to that device via a future software update. Having dual screen support is particularly useful for office workers who may need to drop their computers onto temporary desks, but it could also be helpful for creatives with multiple monitors at home. (If you absolutely need to have your laptop display on alongside two or more external monitors, you'll have to opt for a MacBook Pro with an M3 Pro or Max chip instead.)\n\nBoth new MacBook Air models also support Wi-Fi 6E, an upgrade over the previous Wi-Fi 6 standard with faster speeds and dramatically lower latency. You'll need a Wi-Fi 6E router to actually see those benefits, though. According to Intel, Wi-Fi 6E's ability to tap into seven 160MHz channels helps it avoid congested Wi-Fi 6 spectrum. Basically, you may actually be able to see gigabit speeds more often. (With my AT&T gigabit fiber connection and Wi-Fi 6 gateway, I saw download speeds of around 350 Mbps and uploads ran between 220 Mbps and 320 Mbps on both systems from my basement office. Both upload and download speeds leapt to 700 Mbps when I was on the same floor as the gateway.)\n\nPhoto by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget\n\nDesign and weight\n\nTwo years after the 13-inch M2 MacBook Air debuted, the M3 follow-up is just as sleek and attractive. It seems impossibly thin for a notebook, measuring 0.44 inches thick, and is fairly light at 2.7 pounds. We've seen ultraportables like LG's Gram and the ZenBook S13 OLED that are both lighter and thinner than Apple's hardware, but the MacBook Air still manages to feel like a more premium package. Its unibody aluminum case feels as smooth a river stone yet as sturdy as a boulder. It's a computer I simply love to touch.\n\nPhoto by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget\n\nThe 15-inch M3 MacBook Air is similarly thin, but clocks in half a pound heavier at 3.2 pounds. It's still relatively light for its size, but the additional bulk makes it feel more unwieldy than the 13-inch model. I can easily slip either MacBook Air model into a tote bag when running out to grab my kids from school, but the larger model’s length makes it more annoying to carry.\n\nFor some users, though, that extra heft will be worth it. The bigger MacBook Air sports a 15.3-inch Liquid Retina screen with a sharp 2,880 by 1,864 (224 pixels per inch) resolution, making it better suited for multitasking with multiple windows or working in media editing apps. It's also a better fit for older or visually impaired users, who may have to scale up their displays to make them more readable. (This is something I've noticed while shopping for computers for my parents and other older relatives. 13-inch laptops inevitably become hard to work on, unless you're always wearing bifocals.)\n\nWhile I'm impressed that Apple finally has a large, consumer-focused laptop in its lineup, I still prefer the 13-inch MacBook Air. I spend most of my day writing, Slacking with colleagues, editing photos and talking with companies over video conferencing apps, all of which are easy to do on a smaller screen. If I was directly editing more episodes of the Engadget Podcast, or chopping up video on my own, though, I'd bump up to the 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M3 Pro chip. Even then, I wouldn't have much need for a significantly larger screen.\n\nA lonely headphone jack that could use a USB-C companion. (Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget)\n\nIt's understandable why Apple wouldn't want to tweak the Air's design too much, given that it was just redone a few years ago. Still, I'd love to see a USB-C port on the right side of the machine, just to make charging easier in every location. But I suppose I should just be happy Apple hasn't removed the headphone jack, something that's happening all too frequently in new 13-inch notebooks, like the XPS 13.\n\nHardware\n\nFor our testing, Apple sent the \"midnight\" 13-inch MacBook Air (which is almost jet black and features a fingerprint-resistant coating that actually works), as well as the silver 15-inch model. Both computers were powered by an M3 chip with a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. While these MacBooks start at $1,099 and $1,299, respectively, the configurations we tested cost $400 more. Keep that in mind if you're paying attention to our benchmarks, as you'll definitely see lower figures on the base models. (The cheapest 13-inch offering only has 8GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD and an 8-core GPU, while the entry-level 15-inch unit has the same RAM and storage, along with a 10-core GPU.)\n\n\n\n\n\nGeekbench 6 CPU Geekbench 6 GPU Cinebench R23 3DMark Wildlife Extreme Apple MacBook Air 13-inch (M3, 2024) 3,190/12,102 30,561 1,894/9,037 8,310 Apple MacBook Air 15-inch (M3, 2024) 3,187/12,033 30,556 1,901/9,733 8,253 Apple MacBook Air 13-inch (M2, 2022) 2,570/9,650 25,295 1,576/7,372 6,761 Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M3, 2023) 3,142/11,902 30,462 1,932/10,159 8,139\n\nM3 chip performance\n\nI didn't expect to see a huge performance boost on either MacBook Air, but our benchmarks ended up surprising me. Both laptops scored around 300 points higher in the Cinebench R23 single-core test, compared to the M2 MacBook Air. And when it came to the more strenuous multi-core CPU test, the 13-inch M3 Air was around 1,700 points faster, while the 15-inch model was around 2,400 points faster. (Since both machines are fan-less, there's a good chance the larger case of the 15-inch Air allows for slightly better performance under load.)\n\nThere was a more noticeable difference in Geekbench 6, where the M3 models were around 40 percent faster than before. Apple is touting more middling improvements over the M2 chips — 17 percent faster single-core performance, 21 percent speedier multi-core workloads and 15 percent better GPU workloads — but it's nice to see areas where performance is even better. Really, though, these aren't machines meant to replace M2 systems — the better comparisons are how they measure up to nearly four-year-old M1 Macs or even creakier Intel models. Apple claims the M3 chip is up to 60 percent faster than the M1, but in my testing I saw just a 35 percent speed bump in Cinebench's R23 multi-core test.\n\nWhen it comes to real-world performance, I didn't notice a huge difference between either M3-equipped MacBook Air, compared to the M2 model I've been using for the past few years. Apps load just as quickly, multitasking isn't noticeably faster (thank goodness they have 16GB of RAM), and even photo editing isn't significantly speedier. This is a good time to point out that the M2 MacBook Air is still a fine machine, and it's an even better deal now thanks to a lower $999 starting price. As we've said, the best thing about the existence of the M3 Airs is that they've made the M2 models cheaper. You'll surely find some good deals from stores clearing out older stock and refurbished units, as well as existing owners selling off their M2 machines.\n\nGaming and productivity work\n\nI'll give the M3 MacBook Airs this: they're noticeably faster for gaming. I was able to run Lies of P in 1080p+ (1,920 by 1,200) with high graphics settings and see a smooth 60fps most of the time. It occasionally dipped into the low-50fps range, but that didn't affect the game's playability much. The director's cut of Death Stranding was also smooth and easy to play at that resolution, so long as I didn't crank up the graphics settings too much. It's nice to have the option for some serious games on Macs for once. And if you want more variety, you can also stream high-end games over Xbox's cloud streaming or NVIDIA's GeForce Now.\n\nIn addition to being a bit faster than before, the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs are simply nice computers to use. Their 500-nit screens support HDR and are bright to use outdoors in sunlight. While they're not as impressive as the ProMotion MiniLED displays on the MacBook Pros, they'll get the job done for most users. Apple's quad and six-speaker arrays are also best-in-class, and the 1080p webcams on both computers are perfect for video conferencing (especially when paired with Apple's camera tweaks for brightness and background blurring). And I can’t say enough good things about the MacBook Air’s responsive keyboard and smooth trackpad – I wish every laptop used them.\n\nPhoto by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget\n\nBattery\n\nUnfortunately, the short turn-around time for this review prevented me from running a complete battery test for these computers. At the moment, though, I can say that both machines only used up 40 percent of battery life while playing a 4K fullscreen video at full brightness for over 10 hours. Apple claims they'll play an Apple TV video for up to 18 hours, as well as browse the web wirelessly for up to 15 hours. My testing shows they'll definitely last far more than a typical workday. (I would often go three days without needing to charge the 13-inch M2 MacBook Air. Based on what I've seen so far, I expect similar performance from the M3 models.)\n\nPhoto by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget\n\nWrap-up\n\nThere aren’t any major surprises with the 13-inch and 15-inch M3 MacBook Air, but after years of continual upgrades, that’s to be expected. They’re great computers with excellent performance, gorgeous screens and incredible battery life. And best of all, their introduction also pushes down the prices of the still-great M2 models, making them an even better deal.",

The bigger MacBook Air sports a 15.3-inch Liquid Retina screen with a sharp 2,880 by 1,864 (224 pixels per inch) resolution, making it better suited for multitasking with multiple windows or working in media editing apps. It's also a better fit for older or visually impaired users, who may have to scale up their displays to make them more readable.

I spend most of my day writing, Slacking with colleagues, editing photos and talking with companies over video conferencing apps, all of which are easy to do on a smaller screen. If I was directly editing more episodes of the Engadget Podcast, or chopping up video on my own, though, I'd bump up to the 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M3 Pro chip.

Both computers were powered by an M3 chip with a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. While these MacBooks start at $1,099 and $1,299, respectively, the configurations we tested cost $400 more. Keep that in mind if you're paying attention to our benchmarks, as you'll definitely see lower figures on the base models. (The cheapest 13-inch offering only has 8GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD and an 8-core GPU, while the entry-level 15-inch unit has the same RAM and storage, along with a 10-core GPU.)</p><p><br></p><p>Geekbench 6 CPU</p><p>Geekbench 6 GPU</p><p>Cinebench R23</p><p>3DMark Wildlife Extreme</p><p>Apple MacBook Air 13-inch (M3, 2024)</p><p>3,190/12,102</p><p>30,561</p><p>1,894/9,037</p><p>8,310</p><p>Apple MacBook Air 15-inch (M3, 2024)</p><p>3,187/12,033</p><p>30,556</p><p>1,901/9,733</p><p>8,253</p><p>Apple MacBook Air 13-inch (M2, 2022)</p><p>2,570/9,650</p><p>25,295</p><p>1,576/7,372</p><p>6,761</p><p>Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M3, 2023)</p><p>3,142/11,902</p><p>30,462</p><p>1,932/10,159</p><p>8,139</p><h2>M3 chip performance</h2><p>I didn't expect to see a huge performance boost on either MacBook Air, but our benchmarks ended up surprising me. Both laptops scored around 300 points higher in the Cinebench R23 single-core test, compared to the M2 MacBook Air. And when it came to the more strenuous multi-core CPU test, the 13-inch M3 Air was around 1,700 points faster, while the 15-inch model was around 2,400 points faster. (Since both machines are fan-less, there's a good chance the larger case of the 15-inch Air allows for slightly better performance under load.)</p><p>There was a more noticeable difference in Geekbench 6, where the M3 models were around 40 percent faster than before. Apple is touting more middling improvements over the M2 chips &#8212; 17 percent faster single-core performance, 21 percent speedier multi-core workloads and 15 percent better GPU workloads &#8212; but it's nice to see areas where performance is even better. Really, though, these aren't machines meant to replace M2 systems &#8212; the better comparisons are how they measure up to nearly four-year-old M1 Macs or even creakier Intel models. Apple claims the M3 chip is up to 60 percent faster than the M1, but in my testing I saw just a 35 percent speed bump in Cinebench's R23 multi-core test.</p><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"MacBook Air M3 15-inch front view\"><img alt=\"MacBook Air M3 15-inch front view\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TlusITLbpoEMvXHlSO8aVA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0Mg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/e1642f43-dc14-11ee-9bf7-91dd2b8e9ce2\" class=\"caas-img\"><p>When it comes to real-world performance, I didn't notice a huge difference between either M3-equipped MacBook Air, compared to the M2 model I've been using for the past few years. Apps load just as quickly, multitasking isn't noticeably faster (thank goodness they have 16GB of RAM), and even photo editing isn't significantly speedier. This is a good time to point out that the M2 MacBook Air is still a fine machine, and it's an even better deal now thanks to a lower $999 starting price. As we've said, the best thing about the existence of the M3 Airs is that they've <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-best-thing-about-the-m3-macbook-air-is-the-m2-macbook-air-144543065.html\" class=\"link \">made the M2 models cheaper</a>. You'll surely find some good deals from stores clearing out older stock and refurbished units, as well as existing owners selling off their M2 machines.</p><h2>Gaming and productivity work</h2><p>I'll give the M3 MacBook Airs this: they're noticeably faster for gaming. I was able to run Lies of P in 1080p+ (1,920 by 1,200) with high graphics settings and see a smooth 60fps most of the time. It occasionally dipped into the low-50fps range, but that didn't affect the game's playability much. The director's cut of Death Stranding was also smooth and easy to play at that resolution, so long as I didn't crank up the graphics settings too much. It's nice to have the option for some serious games on Macs for once. And if you want more variety, you can also stream high-end games over Xbox's cloud streaming or NVIDIA's GeForce Now.</p><p>In addition to being a bit faster than before, the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs are simply nice computers to use. Their 500-nit screens support HDR and are bright to use outdoors in sunlight. While they're not as impressive as the ProMotion MiniLED displays on the MacBook Pros, they'll get the job done for most users. Apple's quad and six-speaker arrays are also best-in-class, and the 1080p webcams on both computers are perfect for video conferencing (especially when paired with Apple's camera tweaks for brightness and background blurring). And I can&#8217;t say enough good things about the MacBook Air&#8217;s responsive keyboard and smooth trackpad &#8211; I wish every laptop used them.</p><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"MacBook Air M3 13-inch from the top\"><img alt=\"MacBook Air M3 13-inch from the top\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/27KQudvyFsvkUde.omEqrg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYwNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/e15ae070-dc14-11ee-b9e7-fd0413cbdf8a\" class=\"caas-img\"><p class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><p class=\"caption-credit\"> Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</p></p><h2>Battery</h2><p>Unfortunately, the short turn-around time for this review prevented me from running a complete battery test for these computers. At the moment, though, I can say that both machines only used up 40 percent of battery life while playing a 4K fullscreen video at full brightness for over 10 hours. Apple claims they'll play an Apple TV video for up to 18 hours, as well as browse the web wirelessly for up to 15 hours. My testing shows they'll definitely last far more than a typical workday. (I would often go three days without needing to charge the 13-inch M2 MacBook Air. Based on what I've seen so far, I expect similar performance from the M3 models.)</p><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"MacBook Air M3 13-inch top down\"><img alt=\"MacBook Air M3 13-inch top down\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7YmYOr7E5oKT3CheD0gjfw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYyMg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/e154ed00-dc14-11ee-bb5c-0061ac82ee6c\" class=\"caas-img\"><p class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><p class=\"caption-credit\"> Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</p></p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>There aren&#8217;t any major surprises with the 13-inch and 15-inch M3 MacBook Air, but after years of continual upgrades, that&#8217;s to be expected.

The 13-inch M2 model, released in 2022, was the first major redesign for Apple's most popular notebook in over a decade. Last year, Apple finally gave its fanatics a big-screen ultraportable notebook with the 15-inch MacBook Air. This week, we've got the same two computers with slightly faster chips. They didn't even get a real launch event from Apple, just a sleepy Monday morning press release. They look the same and are a bit faster than before — what else is there to say?\n\nNow, I'm not saying these aren't great computers. It's just that we've been a bit spoiled by Apple's laptops over the last few years. The M3 MacBook Air marks the inevitable innovation plateau for the company, following the monumental rise of its mobile chips and a complete refresh of its laptops and desktops. It's like hitting cruising altitude after the excitement of takeoff — things are stable and comfortable for Apple and consumers alike.\n\nApple 90 100 13-inch MacBook Air (M3) Apple's latest MacBook Air takes everything we loved about the M2 redesign — a sleeker and lighter case — and adds more power thanks to an M3 chip.

Apple is touting more middling improvements over the M2 chips — 17 percent faster single-core performance, 21 percent speedier multi-core workloads and 15 percent better GPU workloads — but it's nice to see areas where performance is even better. Really, though, these aren't machines meant to replace M2 systems — the better comparisons are how they measure up to nearly four-year-old M1 Macs or even creakier Intel models. Apple claims the M3 chip is up to 60 percent faster than the M1, but in my testing I saw just a 35 percent speed bump in Cinebench's R23 multi-core test.\n\nWhen it comes to real-world performance, I didn't notice a huge difference between either M3-equipped MacBook Air, compared to the M2 model I've been using for the past few years. Apps load just as quickly, multitasking isn't noticeably faster (thank goodness they have 16GB of RAM), and even photo editing isn't significantly speedier. This is a good time to point out that the M2 MacBook Air is still a fine machine, and it's an even better deal now thanks to a lower $999 starting price. As we've said, the best thing about the existence of the M3 Airs is that they've made the M2 models cheaper. You'll surely find some good deals from stores clearing out older stock and refurbished units, as well as existing owners selling off their M2 machines.\n\nGaming and productivity work\n\nI'll give the M3 MacBook Airs this: they're noticeably faster for gaming. I was able to run Lies of P in 1080p+ (1,920 by 1,200) with high graphics settings and see a smooth 60fps most of the time. It occasionally dipped into the low-50fps range, but that didn't affect the game's playability much. The director's cut of Death Stranding was also smooth and easy to play at that resolution, so long as I didn't crank up the graphics settings too much. It's nice to have the option for some serious games on Macs for once. And if you want more variety, you can also stream high-end games over Xbox's cloud streaming or NVIDIA's GeForce Now.\n\nIn addition to being a bit faster than before, the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs are simply nice computers to use. Their 500-nit screens support HDR and are bright to use outdoors in sunlight. While they're not as impressive as the ProMotion MiniLED displays on the MacBook Pros, they'll get the job done for most users. Apple's quad and six-speaker arrays are also best-in-class, and the 1080p webcams on both computers are perfect for video conferencing (especially when paired with Apple's camera tweaks for brightness and background blurring). And I can’t say enough good things about the MacBook Air’s responsive keyboard and smooth trackpad – I wish every laptop used them.\n\nPhoto by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget\n\nBattery\n\nUnfortunately, the short turn-around time for this review prevented me from running a complete battery test for these computers. At the moment, though, I can say that both machines only used up 40 percent of battery life while playing a 4K fullscreen video at full brightness for over 10 hours. Apple claims they'll play an Apple TV video for up to 18 hours, as well as browse the web wirelessly for up to 15 hours. My testing shows they'll definitely last far more than a typical workday. (I would often go three days without needing to charge the 13-inch M2 MacBook Air. Based on what I've seen so far, I expect similar performance from the M3 models.)\n\nPhoto by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget\n\nWrap-up\n\nThere aren’t any major surprises with the 13-inch and 15-inch M3 MacBook Air, but after years of continual upgrades, that’s to be expected. They’re great computers with excellent performance, gorgeous screens and incredible battery life. And best of all, their introduction also pushes down the prices of the still-great M2 models, making them an even better deal.",

have a few new features under the hood. For one, they support dual external displays, but only when their lids are closed. That was something even the M3-equipped 14-inch MacBook Pro lacked at launch, but Apple says the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-m3-macbook-pro-is-getting-multi-display-support-just-like-the-air-193844930.html\" class=\"link \">feature is coming to that device </a>via a future software update. Having dual screen support is particularly useful for office workers who may need to drop their computers onto temporary desks, but it could also be helpful for creatives with multiple monitors at home. (If you absolutely need to have your laptop display on alongside two or more external monitors, you'll have to opt for a MacBook Pro with an M3 Pro or Max chip instead.)</p><p>Both new MacBook Air models also support Wi-Fi 6E, an upgrade over the previous Wi-Fi 6 standard with faster speeds and dramatically lower latency. You'll need a Wi-Fi 6E router to actually see those benefits, though. <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2d327af4-8b42-4ff1-a409-ae7bf906e9e9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Intel&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnRlbC5jb20vY29udGVudC93d3cvdXMvZW4vcHJvZHVjdHMvZG9jcy93aXJlbGVzcy93aS1maS02ZS5odG1sIzp-OnRleHQ9Q29tcGFyaW5nJTIwV2klMkRGaSUyMDZFJTIwYW5kJTIwV2klMkRGaSUyMDYmdGV4dD1UaGUlMjBtb3N0JTIwaW1wYWN0ZnVsJTIwZGlmZmVyZW5jZSUyMGlzLCUyQyUyMDUlMkMlMjBhbmQlMjA2JTIwZGV2aWNlcy4iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjAzOTRjMmM0LWUzYzItNDQyMy1hYTNjLTkyNjA2NjNhNjIyZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZdQYFwhHLNMVuiA-a7RmnPvlVbiFgxw8zpEbFhpjlNV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.intel.com%2Fcontent%2Fwww%2Fus%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Fdocs%2Fwireless%2Fwi-fi-6e.html%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DComparing%2520Wi%252DFi%25206E%2520and%2520Wi%252DFi%25206%26text%3DThe%2520most%2520impactful%2520difference%2520is%2C%252C%25205%252C%2520and%25206%2520devices.\" class=\"link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">According to Intel</a>, Wi-Fi 6E's ability to tap into seven 160MHz channels helps it avoid congested Wi-Fi 6 spectrum.

It seems impossibly thin for a notebook, measuring 0.44 inches thick, and is fairly light at 2.7 pounds. We've seen ultraportables like LG's Gram and the <a href=\"https://press.asus.com/news/asus-zenbook-s-13-oled-2024-intel-core-ultra-7/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link \">ZenBook S13 OLED</a> that are both lighter and thinner than Apple's hardware, but the MacBook Air still manages to feel like a more premium package. Its unibody aluminum case feels as smooth a river stone yet as sturdy as a boulder. It's a computer I simply love to touch.</p><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Holding the MacBook Air M3 13-inch \"><img alt=\"Holding the MacBook Air M3 13-inch \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9yxraCgxXOg1QFXAy3glpw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU1Ng--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/e1642f42-dc14-11ee-a3ef-d9d46bef1315\" class=\"caas-img\"><p class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><p class=\"caption-credit\"> Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</p></p><p>The 15-inch M3 MacBook Air is similarly thin, but clocks in half a pound heavier at 3.2 pounds. It's still relatively light for its size, but the additional bulk makes it feel more unwieldy than the 13-inch model. I can easily slip either MacBook Air model into a tote bag when running out to grab my kids from school, but the larger model&#8217;s length makes it more annoying to carry.</p><p>For some users, though, that extra heft will be worth it. The bigger MacBook Air sports a 15.3-inch Liquid Retina screen with a sharp 2,880 by 1,864 (224 pixels per inch) resolution, making it better suited for multitasking with multiple windows or working in media editing apps. It's also a better fit for older or visually impaired users, who may have to scale up their displays to make them more readable. (This is something I've noticed while shopping for computers for my parents and other older relatives. 13-inch laptops inevitably become hard to work on, unless you're always wearing bifocals.)</p><p>While I'm impressed that Apple finally has a large, consumer-focused laptop in its lineup, I still prefer the 13-inch MacBook Air. I spend most of my day writing, Slacking with colleagues, editing photos and talking with companies over video conferencing apps, all of which are easy to do on a smaller screen. If I was directly editing more episodes of the Engadget Podcast, or chopping up video on my own, though, I'd bump up to the 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M3 Pro chip. Even then, I wouldn't have much need for a significantly larger screen.</p><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"MacBook Air M3 13-inch and 15-inch headphone jack\"><img alt=\"MacBook Air M3 13-inch and 15-inch headphone jack\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/t5AEMTNp3Yv623AUsm_uCQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/e1549ee0-dc14-11ee-b9f9-eaca1c63e3b5\" class=\"caas-img\"><p class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\">A lonely headphone jack that could use a USB-C companion.<p class=\"caption-credit\"> (Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget)</p></p><p>It's understandable why Apple wouldn't want to tweak the Air's design too much, given that it was just redone a few years ago. Still, I'd love to see a USB-C port on the right side of the machine, just to make charging easier in every location. But I suppose I should just be happy Apple hasn't removed the headphone jack, something that's happening all too frequently in new 13-inch notebooks, like the XPS 13.</p><h2>Hardware</h2><p>For our testing, Apple sent the \"midnight\" 13-inch MacBook Air (which is almost jet black and features a fingerprint-resistant coating that actually works), as well as the silver 15-inch model. Both computers were powered by an M3 chip with a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. While these MacBooks start at $1,099 and $1,299, respectively, the configurations we tested cost $400 more. Keep that in mind if you're paying attention to our benchmarks, as you'll definitely see lower figures on the base models. (The cheapest 13-inch offering only has 8GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD and an 8-core GPU, while the entry-level 15-inch unit has the same RAM and storage, along with a 10-core GPU.)</p><p><br></p><p>Geekbench 6 CPU</p><p>Geekbench 6 GPU</p><p>Cinebench R23</p><p>3DMark Wildlife Extreme</p><p>Apple MacBook Air 13-inch (M3, 2024)</p><p>3,190/12,102</p><p>30,561</p><p>1,894/9,037</p><p>8,310</p><p>Apple MacBook Air 15-inch (M3, 2024)</p><p>3,187/12,033</p><p>30,556</p><p>1,901/9,733</p><p>8,253</p><p>Apple MacBook Air 13-inch (M2, 2022)</p><p>2,570/9,650</p><p>25,295</p><p>1,576/7,372</p><p>6,761</p><p>Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M3, 2023)</p><p>3,142/11,902</p><p>30,462</p><p>1,932/10,159</p><p>8,139</p><h2>M3 chip performance</h2><p>I didn't expect to see a huge performance boost on either MacBook Air, but our benchmarks ended up surprising me. Both laptops scored around 300 points higher in the Cinebench R23 single-core test, compared to the M2 MacBook Air. And when it came to the more strenuous multi-core CPU test, the 13-inch M3 Air was around 1,700 points faster, while the 15-inch model was around 2,400 points faster. (Since both machines are fan-less, there's a good chance the larger case of the 15-inch Air allows for slightly better performance under load.)</p><p>There was a more noticeable difference in Geekbench 6, where the M3 models were around 40 percent faster than before. Apple is touting more middling improvements over the M2 chips &#8212; 17 percent faster single-core performance, 21 percent speedier multi-core workloads and 15 percent better GPU workloads &#8212; but it's nice to see areas where performance is even better. Really, though, these aren't machines meant to replace M2 systems &#8212; the better comparisons are how they measure up to nearly four-year-old M1 Macs or even creakier Intel models. Apple claims the M3 chip is up to 60 percent faster than the M1, but in my testing I saw just a 35 percent speed bump in Cinebench's R23 multi-core test.</p><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"MacBook Air M3 15-inch front view\"><img alt=\"MacBook Air M3 15-inch front view\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TlusITLbpoEMvXHlSO8aVA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0Mg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/e1642f43-dc14-11ee-9bf7-91dd2b8e9ce2\" class=\"caas-img\"><p>When it comes to real-world performance, I didn't notice a huge difference between either M3-equipped MacBook Air, compared to the M2 model I've been using for the past few years. Apps load just as quickly, multitasking isn't noticeably faster (thank goodness they have 16GB of RAM), and even photo editing isn't significantly speedier. This is a good time to point out that the M2 MacBook Air is still a fine machine, and it's an even better deal now thanks to a lower $999 starting price. As we've said, the best thing about the existence of the M3 Airs is that they've <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-best-thing-about-the-m3-macbook-air-is-the-m2-macbook-air-144543065.html\" class=\"link \">made the M2 models cheaper</a>. You'll surely find some good deals from stores clearing out older stock and refurbished units, as well as existing owners selling off their M2 machines.</p><h2>Gaming and productivity work</h2><p>I'll give the M3 MacBook Airs this: they're noticeably faster for gaming. I was able to run Lies of P in 1080p+ (1,920 by 1,200) with high graphics settings and see a smooth 60fps most of the time. It occasionally dipped into the low-50fps range, but that didn't affect the game's playability much. The director's cut of Death Stranding was also smooth and easy to play at that resolution, so long as I didn't crank up the graphics settings too much. It's nice to have the option for some serious games on Macs for once. And if you want more variety, you can also stream high-end games over Xbox's cloud streaming or NVIDIA's GeForce Now.</p><p>In addition to being a bit faster than before, the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs are simply nice computers to use. Their 500-nit screens support HDR and are bright to use outdoors in sunlight. While they're not as impressive as the ProMotion MiniLED displays on the MacBook Pros, they'll get the job done for most users. Apple's quad and six-speaker arrays are also best-in-class, and the 1080p webcams on both computers are perfect for video conferencing (especially when paired with Apple's camera tweaks for brightness and background blurring). And I can&#8217;t say enough good things about the MacBook Air&#8217;s responsive keyboard and smooth trackpad &#8211; I wish every laptop used them.</p><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"MacBook Air M3 13-inch from the top\"><img alt=\"MacBook Air M3 13-inch from the top\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/27KQudvyFsvkUde.omEqrg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYwNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/e15ae070-dc14-11ee-b9e7-fd0413cbdf8a\" class=\"caas-img\"><p class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><p class=\"caption-credit\"> Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</p></p><h2>Battery</h2><p>Unfortunately, the short turn-around time for this review prevented me from running a complete battery test for these computers. At the moment, though, I can say that both machines only used up 40 percent of battery life while playing a 4K fullscreen video at full brightness for over 10 hours. Apple claims they'll play an Apple TV video for up to 18 hours, as well as browse the web wirelessly for up to 15 hours. My testing shows they'll definitely last far more than a typical workday. (I would often go three days without needing to charge the 13-inch M2 MacBook Air. Based on what I've seen so far, I expect similar performance from the M3 models.)</p><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"MacBook Air M3 13-inch top down\"><img alt=\"MacBook Air M3 13-inch top down\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7YmYOr7E5oKT3CheD0gjfw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYyMg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/e154ed00-dc14-11ee-bb5c-0061ac82ee6c\" class=\"caas-img\"><p class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><p class=\"caption-credit\"> Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</p></p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>There aren&#8217;t any major surprises with the 13-inch and 15-inch M3 MacBook Air, but after years of continual upgrades, that&#8217;s to be expected. They&#8217;re great computers with excellent performance, gorgeous screens and incredible battery life. And best of all, their introduction also pushes down the prices of the still-great M2 models, making them an even better deal.</p></div>",

The 13-inch Air maintains its sleek design and weighs 2.7 pounds, while the 15-inch model offers a larger 15.3-inch screen and weighs 3.2 pounds. Both models feature dual external display support, Wi-Fi 6E connectivity, and improved battery life. The 13-inch Air is well-suited for web browsing, productivity tasks, and basic photo editing, while the 15-inch model is better for multitasking, media editing, and visually impaired users. The M3 chip provides noticeable performance improvements in gaming, but overall, the differences in performance between the M3 and M2 models are relatively minor for everyday use."

The midnight one is already covered in smudges, while the starlight shines bright, free of visible finger oils. But at least I can tell these two apart.\n\nThe chassis of the 13-inch and 15-inch Air M3s are the same as their M2 predecessors: same wedgeless design, same dimensions and weight, same colorway options — same everything. If the two were side by side, you probably wouldn’t be able to tell which ones have an M2 chip and which ones have an M3.\n\nYou’d have to fire them up and run some benchmarks to tell the difference from the M2 models. Based on my time with the MacBook Pro 14 M3, I expect the Air M3s to have about a 10 to 15 percent performance increase over the M2 Airs and equivalent (if not identical) performance to the MacBook Pro 14 M3. Both the 13-inch and 15-inch Air M3 review units I received have an eight-core CPU, 10-core GPU, and 16GB of RAM, albeit a 512GB SSD instead of a 1TB SSD.\n\nFocusing on the 13-inch MacBook Air for a minute, the major differences between the M2 and M3 versions are that the M3 supports hardware-accelerated ray tracing, the AV1 decode engine (a newer video codec that reduces bandwidth demands while streaming), and Wi-Fi 6E. From configuration options to battery life, little has changed, except the M3 models can finally power two external displays with the laptop closed. The M1 and M2 Airs could only use one, and the lid had to be open. (The base-model 14-inch MacBook Pro M3 will be able to run two external displays, too, after a software update — no word on the M1 and M2 Airs, though.)\n\nApple says the midnight colorway should be less prone to fingerprints. So far, that does not seem to be the case. Photo by Joanna Nelius / The Verge\n\nSame goes for the 15-inch MacBook Air, although its six-speaker sound system is noticeably better than the 13-inch’s four-speaker system. I tossed on some of my favorite songs that go hard on the low-end bass (any Combichrist fans here?), and the 15-inch produced noticeably boomier bass lines than the 13-inch, which had as much base as a retro record player spinning vinyl.\n\nBut the speakers on the MacBook Pro 14 sound just as good, if not identical, to the 15-inch MacBook Air M3! If you’re considering the 14-inch MacBook Pro M3, the latest MacBook Airs muddle Apple’s lineup even more, leaving fewer reasons to go for the Pro model unless you want something with a fancier display or a couple more ports.\n\nThe Pro and Air models are also so close in weight and size that I’m not sure what the MacBook Air even means in an era where every single laptop company has thin and lightweight laptops. The gold standard for thickness and weight has shrunk every year since Apple released its first MacBook Air in 2008. Hell, the MacBook Pro 14 M3 is thinner than the original Air!\n\nAnd now that its wedge design is officially gone, what makes an Air an Air when it looks the same as a Pro? Although I am a Windows gal, I’ve had a few work MacBooks over the years. The one I have now is a MacBook Air M1, and at least I can put it next to a MacBook Pro, point to it, and say, “That’s a MacBook Air,” because the wedge design was and still is iconic.",

This is where I'm at with my Intel-based 16-inch MacBook Pro, which I use for work. Testing the updated MacBook Airs with Apple's M3 chips only made its performance shortcomings that much more apparent. I mean, there's a good reason Apple keeps pitting the M3's performance gains against older M1- and Intel-based MacBook Airs: Those are the people who stand to gain the most by upgrading.\n\nThat's not to say the M3 silicon isn't also an improvement over the M2, because it is. It's just that the performance differences are overall modest, but graphics performance does get a notable bump, similar to the 14- and 16-inch M3 MacBook Pro models we reviewed last year. In fact, the base 14-inch MacBook Pro has the same M3 chip that's standard on the updated 15-inch MacBook Air and an upgrade on the 13-inch. And while creators looking for a big power boost will likely want an M3 Pro or Max chip, the regular M3 is well-suited for the Air's eminently portable design, and it absolutely trounced my Intel MacBook Pro.\n\nThe rest of the M3 MacBook Air is great too and pretty much the same as the M2 models -- another reason those with M1 and earlier models will want to consider upgrading.\n\nRead more: Best M3 MacBook Air Deals\n\nWatch this: M3 MacBook Air Review: A Better Reason to Upgrade? 07:19\n\nApple MacBook Air (M3, 13-inch, 2024) Price as reviewed $1,499 Display size/resolution 13.6-inch 2,560x1,664 Liquid Retina LED backlit display CPU Apple M3 chip 8-core CPU Memory 16GB unified memory Graphics Apple 10-core GPU Storage 512GB SSD Networking Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax); Bluetooth 5.3 Operating system Apple macOS Sonoma 14.4\n\nThe 13- and 15-inch M3 MacBook Airs look the same as the M2 versions. Josh Goldman/CNET\n\nThe same, but also better\n\nThe new Airs start at a similar US price as before: $1,099 (£1,099, AU$1,799) for the 13-inch Air with 8GB of unified memory and 256GB solid-state drive. The 15-inch Air, also with 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD, starts at $1,299 (£1,299, AU$2,199). From there you can increase memory to 16GB or 24GB and storage to 512GB, 1TB or 2TB. The base M3 on the 13-inch model has eight CPU and eight GPU cores. You can upgrade to an M3 with a 10-core GPU for $100 or, if you add more memory or storage ($200 each), Apple also the 10-core GPU M3 to the configuration. This chip is also standard on the 15-inch size. Both chip versions have a 16-core Neural Engine to accelerate AI and machine learning tasks.\n\nThe base 8GB of memory and 256GB of storage seem stingy given the $1,099 starting price. While, in our experience, the MacBook Air runs well on 8GB of unified memory, it will limit what you can do and the overall performance longevity of the laptop. Storage can always be bolstered with external drives or cloud storage, but there's no such option for memory. If you can afford the extra $200, get 16GB of memory.\n\nThe midnight finish has a fingerprint-resistant seal. Josh Goldman/CNET\n\nAll of the key features and design elements introduced with the M2 redesign are carried over to the M3 MacBook Airs. So that means things like the fanless body made from recycled aluminum, the beautiful Liquid Retina displays, the excellent 1080p FaceTime camera, the great-sounding speaker systems, MagSafe 3 charging and dual Thunderbolt-USB 4 ports, are all part of the M3 Air package. The colors are the same as before too -- midnight, starlight, silver and space gray -- and the midnight finish has an anodization seal to reduce fingerprints.\n\nHowever, that also means things like the camera notch at the top of the displays, the fact that there's Touch ID on the keyboard but still no Face ID to match the iPhone and iPad, and that the MagSafe connector and both USB-C ports are crowded on the left side, so there's no option to charge from the right side, are still here too. Changes like these typically wouldn't get made until there's another major redesign, so I didn't expect them. That doesn't make them any less detracting for me, though.\n\nYou can have two external displays, but you can't have three. Josh Goldman/CNET\n\nApple did make two feature additions with the M3 chip update. One is a move from Wi-Fi 6 to 6E, which translates to faster wireless speeds, assuming you have a router that supports it. The other change is to display support. Prior models of the MacBook Air supported extending to only one external display. With the M3 MacBook Airs, you can connect two external displays directly to the Thunderbolt USB-C ports, which will also power the MacBook.\n\nHowever, doing this comes at the cost of the MacBook Air's display; the lid must be closed in order to drive both external monitors. On the surface, this doesn't seem like much of an issue, unless you typically use your laptop's keyboard and trackpad while working on an external display. For me, the bigger hiccup is the loss of Touch ID on the Air's keyboard. You can just open and close the lid to use Touch ID, but I use mine so much during the day that that would get old really fast. The better option is to get Apple's Magic Keyboard with Touch ID, and while you're at it, pick up a Magic Trackpad or Mouse to complete the package.\n\nNo changes to the trackpads or keyboards for the M3 models. Josh Goldman/CNET\n\nBut that's pretty much it for new features for the M3 Airs. And if you're looking for big differences between the 13- and 15-inch models, there really aren't any. Aside from the obvious size difference and that the base M3 chip on the 15-inch has a 10-core GPU, there's also a difference in their speakers. The 13-inch has a four-speaker sound system, while the 15-inch has six speakers with force-canceling woofers. Both sound remarkably good. Seriously, I've listened to hundreds of laptop sound systems over my years of reviewing, and few sound as good.\n\nSo again, if you already have an M2 MacBook Air, the reasons to upgrade are limited. If you're a creator or want to play more demanding games -- we played a little Baldur's Gate and Death Stranding, for example -- trading in an M2 Air for a shiny new M3 MacBook Air might make sense. On the other hand, for M1 MacBook Air or Intel-based Air owners (or Intel MacBook Pro owners for that matter), the reasons to upgrade are plentiful.\n\nWe've only had the new Airs for a few days, but we were able to run our benchmark tests and the performance essentially matches that of the 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro we tested late last year. The M3 Air is generally faster than the M2 Air, but again, it's the graphics performance that really shines. And my work laptop, a 2019 Intel-based MacBook Pro, was no match for the M3.\n\nFor good measure, we also tested a new Lenovo Slim 7, which is a 14-inch OLED laptop with an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor, integrated Arc graphics, 32GB of memory and a 1TB SSD for around $1,000. Its performance pretty much matches the M3's except for, again, graphics, where the Lenovo was competitive with... the M1 MacBook Air from 2020, so Intel clearly still has some work to catch up there.\n\nJosh Goldman/CNET\n\nAnyway, if you're wondering about battery life, we frankly haven't been able to fully test that in the short time we've had the new models. These will likely run close to the 18 hours Apple claims; the 14-inch M3 Pro ran for nearly 19 hours in our tests. That's also why we haven't put a final rating on this review.\n\nRegardless, the M3 MacBook Air, either size, is an easy recommendation. If you're ready to upgrade from an older MacBook Air, either the M2 or M3 models will be a significant improvement. The 13-inch M2 MacBook Air is now the $999 entry-level model, and Apple has discontinued the 15-inch M2 Air, so you can probably find some good deals on that right now. But if you plan to use your MacBook Air for STEM work, or design work, or rendering video or editing raw photos, the M3 is the better choice, and you should get at least 16GB of memory.\n\nGeekbench 6 (multicore) Lenovo Slim 7i (14-inch 2024) 12128 Apple MacBook Air (M3, 13-inch, 2024) 12063 Apple MacBook Pro (M3, 14-inch, 2023) 12049 Apple MacBook Air (M3, 15-inch, 2024) 12034 Apple MacBook Air (M2, 15-inch, 2023) 9859 Apple MacBook Air (M1, 13-inch, 2020) 8710 Apple MacBook Pro (Intel, 16-inch, 2019) 5342 Note: Longer bars indicate better performance\n\nJetStream2 (JavaScript and WebAssembly benchmark) in Chrome Apple MacBook Air (M3, 15-inch, 2024) 345.887 Apple MacBook Air (M3, 13-inch, 2024) 344.316 Apple MacBook Pro (M3, 14-inch, 2023) 336.076 Lenovo Slim 7i (14-inch 2024) 291.115 Apple MacBook Air (M2, 15-inch 2023) 264.984 Apple MacBook Air (M1, 13-inch, 2020) 248.222 Apple MacBook Pro (Intel, 16-inch, 2019) 173.313 Note: Longer bars indicate better performance\n\nCinebench 2024 CPU (multicore) Apple MacBook Pro (M3, 14-inch, 2023) 710 Lenovo Slim 7i (14-inch 2024) 628 Apple MacBook Air (M3, 15-inch, 2024) 591 Apple MacBook Air (M2, 15-inch 2023) 552 Apple MacBook Air (M3, 13-inch, 2024) 541 Apple MacBook Air (M1, 13-inch, 2020) 449 Apple MacBook Pro (Intel, 16-inch, 2019) 384 Note: Longer bars indicate better performance",

This is where I'm at with my Intel-based 16-inch MacBook Pro, which I use for work. Testing the <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/apple-updates-macbook-air-with-m3-dual-monitor-support/\" rel=\"follow\" target=\"_self\">updated MacBook Airs with Apple's M3 chips</a> only made its performance shortcomings that much more apparent.

Its performance pretty much matches the M3's except for, again, graphics, where the Lenovo was competitive with... the M1 MacBook Air from 2020, so Intel clearly still has some work to catch up there.&#160;</p> <img src alt=\"Apple MacBook Air M3 13-inch laptop on a wood table with windows in the background.\" height=\"675.9259259259259\" width=\"1200\"> <img src=\"https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/2c16d37f3934a5892baec149f93c62d189d9660b/hub/2024/03/06/f6e017d8-7b53-49f9-a41c-2df3185a2b41/apple-macbook-air-m3-2024-12.jpg?auto=webp&amp;width=1200\" alt=\"Apple MacBook Air M3 13-inch laptop on a wood table with windows in the background.\" height=\"675.9259259259259\" width=\"1200\">  <p class=\"c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall\">Josh Goldman/CNET</p><p>Anyway, if you're wondering about battery life, we frankly haven't been able to fully test that in the short time we've had the new models. These will likely run close to the 18 hours Apple claims; the 14-inch M3 Pro ran for nearly 19 hours in our tests. That's also why we haven't put a final rating on this review.&#160;</p><p>Regardless, the M3 MacBook Air, either size, is an easy recommendation. If you're ready to upgrade from an older MacBook Air, either the M2 or M3 models will be a significant improvement. The 13-inch M2 MacBook Air is now the $999 entry-level model, and Apple has discontinued the 15-inch M2 Air, so you can probably find some <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-macbook-air-15-laptop-m2-chip-16gb-memory-1tb-ssd-midnight%2F6382794.p%3FskuId%3D6382794&amp;publisher_slug=cnet&amp;article_name=__ARTICLE_NAME__&amp;article_url=__ARTICLE_URL__&amp;exclusive=1&amp;u1=subid_value\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">good deals on that right now</a>. But if you plan to use your MacBook Air for STEM work, or design work, or rendering video or editing raw photos, the M3 is the better choice, and you should get at least 16GB of memory.&#160;</p><h2

While its base configuration with 8GB memory and 256GB storage may be limiting, upgrading to 16GB memory is recommended for enhanced longevity. The design remains largely unchanged from the M2 models, but the midnight finish now has a fingerprint-resistant seal. The 13-inch and 15-inch sizes offer similar features, except for the 15-inch's 10-core GPU on the base model and six-speaker sound system. The M3 MacBook Air is highly recommended for those upgrading from M1 or older models, offering a significant performance boost, but the M2 Air remains a viable option for those on a budget."

                        "newstext": "Right off the bat, the M3 MacBook Airs aren't as interesting as the M2 models.\n\nJuly 2022's M2 MacBook Air updated the design of the 13-inch laptop for the Apple Silicon era after the M1 Air's external design played it safe. And the first-ever 15-inch MacBook Air, released over a year later, was an appealing option for people who wanted a larger screen but didn't need the extra power or cost of a MacBook Pro. Together, they were a comprehensive rethink of Apple's approach to its mainstream laptops, modeled after the similarly dramatic Apple Silicon MacBook Pro redesigns.\n\nThe M3 Airs don't do any of that. They are laptop designs we've already seen, wrapped around a processor we've already seen. But they may end up being more important than the M2 Airs because of when they're being released—as the last of the Intel Macs slowly age and break and Apple winds down software support for them (if not in this year's macOS release, then almost certainly next year's). Between the faster chip and a couple of other feature updates, the new machines may also be the first ones that are truly worth a look for M1 Air early adopters who want an upgrade.\n\nApple left us a scant 48 hours to test and use this laptop, but here's what we've observed so far.\n\nDoes the design hold up?\n\nAndrew Cunningham\n\nAndrew Cunningham\n\nThe M1 MacBook Air is still the one I use most days, and anyone coming from a 2018–2020 Intel MacBook Air will be familiar with the design. So the M2/M3-era MacBook Air design is still striking to me, despite being the better part of two years old.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy and large, I think the newer design holds up pretty well; I don't mind the loss of the taper, even if it makes the laptop look a bit more boxy and less sleek. The full-height function row and tweaked keyboard are both good, and I don't generally have issues with trackpad palm rejection on either the 13- or 15-inch models. It's nice to have MagSafe back, though in the end, I almost always charge the Air with one of the many USB-C chargers I have strategically tucked into most rooms in the house.\n\nSpecs at a glance: Apple M3 MacBook Air (as reviewed) Screen 13.6-inch 2560×1664 IPS LCD 15.3-inch 2880×1864 OS macOS 14.4 Sonoma CPU Apple M3 (4 E-cores, 4 P-cores) RAM 16GB unified memory GPU Apple M3 (10 GPU cores) Storage 512GB soldered SSD Battery 52.6 WHr 66.5 WHr Networking Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax), Bluetooth 5.3 Ports 2x Thunderbolt/USB4, MagSafe 3, headphones Size 11.97×8.46×0.44 inches (304.1×215×113 mm) 13.40×9.35×0.45 inches (340.4×237.6×115 mm) Weight 2.7 lbs (1.24 kg) 3.3 lbs (1.51 kg) Warranty 1-year Price as reviewed $1,499 $1,699 Other perks 1080p webcam, TouchID\n\nI'm also reminded anew of just how much I like the 15-inch MacBook Air as someone who likes a big screen but doesn't use a laptop for much gaming or anything heavier than Photoshop or Lightroom (and I generally don't care that much about high-refresh-rate displays). The combination of size and weight really is close to ideal, and though the 15-inch Air is unmistakably larger and heavier than the 13-inch model, the difference isn't so large in daily use that I spend a lot of time thinking about it. The improved speaker setup is also nice to have when you're playing music or using that bigger screen to watch something.\n\nThe biggest downside of the design remains the display notch. As we and others have noted multiple times, it's not that you don't get used to it, and in typical desktop use (especially in dark mode and with a dark wallpaper), you can often forget it's there. But in the absence of FaceID or some major other functional addition, it feels like a lot of space to take up for not a lot of user-visible benefit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSure, a 1080p webcam instead of a 720p webcam is nice, but I would choose a notch-less screen with more usable space every time if given the choice. (The strips of screen to either side of the notch can only really display the macOS menu bar; go into the Control Center area of the Settings and change \"automatically hide and show the Menu Bar' to \"Never\" if you don't want those strips of screen to go totally wasted in full-screen mode).\n\nAndrew Cunningham\n\nAndrew Cunningham\n\nOne design change that Apple has highlighted for the M3 Airs is a new coating for the Midnight (read: blue-tinted black) version of the Air that is said to reduce its fingerprint-y-ness. Apple did the same thing for the M3 version of the MacBook Pro last year.\n\nThe new finish looks a shade or two lighter than the old Midnight coating and does show fingerprints a bit less. But \"less\" isn't \"none,\" and my Air was immediately, visibly fingerprint-y and skin-oily, both on the lid and in the palm rest area. It remains more noticeable than on either the Starlight finish of the 13-inch M3 Air or the space gray finish on my M1 Air. Choose your color finish accordingly.",

So the M2/M3-era MacBook Air design is still striking to me, despite being the better part of two years old.</p>                                            \n    <p class=\"ad_notice\">Advertisement </p>    \n    <p class=\"ad ad_instream\"></p>    \n\n                                                        \n<p>By and large, I think the newer design holds up pretty well; I don't mind the loss of the taper, even if it makes the laptop look a bit more boxy and less sleek. The full-height function row and tweaked keyboard are both good, and I don't generally have issues with trackpad palm rejection on either the 13- or 15-inch models. It's nice to have MagSafe back, though in the end, I almost always charge the Air with one of the many USB-C chargers I have strategically tucked into most rooms in the house.</p>\n\n\n\nSpecs at a glance: Apple M3 MacBook Air (as reviewed)\n\n\nScreen\n13.6-inch 2560&#215;1664 IPS LCD\n15.3-inch 2880&#215;1864\n\n\nOS\nmacOS 14.4 Sonoma\n\n\nCPU\nApple M3 (4 E-cores, 4 P-cores)\n\n\nRAM\n16GB unified memory\n\n\nGPU\nApple M3 (10 GPU cores)\n\n\nStorage\n512GB soldered SSD\n\n\nBattery\n52.6 WHr\n66.5 WHr\n\n\nNetworking\nWi-Fi 6E (802.11ax), Bluetooth 5.3\n\n\nPorts\n2x Thunderbolt/USB4, MagSafe 3, headphones\n\n\nSize\n11.97&#215;8.46&#215;0.44 inches (304.1&#215;215&#215;113 mm)\n13.40&#215;9.35&#215;0.45 inches (340.4&#215;237.6&#215;115 mm)\n\n\nWeight\n2.7 lbs (1.24 kg)\n3.3 lbs (1.51 kg)\n\n\nWarranty\n1-year\n\n\nPrice as reviewed\n$1,499\n$1,699\n\n\nOther perks\n1080p webcam, TouchID\n\n\n\n<p>I'm also reminded anew of just how much I like the 15-inch MacBook Air as someone who likes a big screen but doesn't use a laptop for much gaming or anything heavier than Photoshop or Lightroom (and I generally don't care that much about high-refresh-rate displays). The combination of size and weight really is close to ideal, and though the 15-inch Air is unmistakably larger and heavier than the 13-inch model, the difference isn't so large in daily use that I spend a lot of time thinking about it. The improved speaker setup is also nice to have when you're playing music or using that bigger screen to watch something.</p>\n<p>The biggest downside of the design remains the display notch. As we and others have noted multiple times, it's not that you don't get used to it, and in typical desktop use (especially in dark mode and with a dark wallpaper), you can often forget it's there. But in the absence of FaceID or some major other functional addition, it feels like a lot of space to take up for not a lot of user-visible benefit.</p>                                            \n    <p class=\"ad_notice\">Advertisement </p>    \n    <p class=\"ad ad_instream\"></p>    \n\n                                                        \n<p>Sure, a 1080p webcam instead of a 720p webcam is nice, but I would choose a notch-less screen with more usable space every time if given the choice. (The strips of screen to either side of the notch can only really display the macOS menu bar; go into the Control Center area of the Settings and change \"automatically hide and show the Menu Bar' to \"Never\" if you don't want those strips of screen to go totally wasted in full-screen mode).</p>\n  <ul>\n              <li>\n          \n            <p class=\"image\"></p>\n                          \n                <p class=\"icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator\"></p>\n                                   \n                                                  <p class=\"credit\">\n                    <p class=\"icon icon-camera\"></p>\n                                          Andrew Cunningham                                      </p>\n                              \n                      \n        </li>\n              <li>\n          \n            <p class=\"image\"></p>\n                          \n                <p class=\"icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator\"></p>\n                                   \n                                                  <p class=\"credit\">\n                    <p class=\"icon icon-camera\"></p>\n                                          Andrew Cunningham                                      </p>\n                              \n                      \n        </li>\n          </ul>\n  <p>One design change that Apple has highlighted for the M3 Airs is a new coating for the Midnight (read: blue-tinted black) version of the Air that is said to reduce its fingerprint-y-ness. Apple did the same thing for the M3 version of the MacBook Pro last year.</p>\n<p>The new finish looks a shade or two lighter than the old Midnight coating and does show fingerprints a bit less. But \"less\" isn't \"none,\" and my Air was immediately, visibly fingerprint-y and skin-oily, both on the lid and in the palm rest area. It remains more noticeable than on either the Starlight finish of the 13-inch M3 Air or the space gray finish on my M1 Air. Choose your color finish accordingly.</p>\n\n                                                </div>",

While they do not introduce significant design changes, the M3 Airs are expected to attract users due to their timing, as they replace aging Intel Macs and offer performance enhancements over the M1 Air. Notable features of the M3 Airs include a slightly brighter Midnight finish, marginally improved fingerprint resistance, and an upgraded 1080p webcam, making them a potential upgrade choice for early adopters of the M1 Air."

                        "newstext": "Apple’s plans to comply with the European Union’s new rules governing big tech have already gotten off to an interesting start, and not just because Apple pulled Epic Games’ developer license. Apple made last-minute tweaks to the Digital Markets Act (DMA) compliance plan to add flexibility, but they’ve met mixed reactions among developers.\n\nDevelopers considering Apple’s post-DMA fee structure, which comes with a new “Core Technology Fee,” can now try them out and then switch back to the original terms — instead of, as originally announced, making the change a one-way trip. In an update posted on Tuesday, Apple says it created the “one-time option” to revert to Apple’s standard agreement in case of “unexpected business changes” or if developers just change their minds. But there’s a caveat: developers can only switch back if they didn’t put their apps on an alternative app store or use alternative payment options.\n\nApple’s new rules let developers distribute their apps on third-party marketplaces and use alternative payment options. Even if they don’t distribute outside the App Store, they can opt in to the new structure and benefit from a lower App Store commission rate. But if their app has more than 1 million annual installs a year, they’ll need to pay that 50 euro cent fee for every additional installation and update — which can add up, especially for popular freemium apps.\n\nAs described by Apple, here are the updates the company made to its DMA policies on Tuesday: Decisioning by membership: To make it easier for more developers to sign up for the new terms, we’ve removed the corporate entity requirement that the Addendum must be signed by each membership that controls, is controlled by, or is under control with another membership. This means an entity can now choose to sign up for the new terms at the developer account level. Switching back: To help reduce the risk of unexpected business changes under the new terms, such as reaching massive scale more quickly than anticipated, or if you simply change your mind, we’ve created a one-time option to terminate the Addendum under certain circumstances and switch back to Apple’s standard business terms for your EU apps. For details, view the Addendum. Alternative app marketplace requirements: To make it easier for developers who want to create alternative app marketplaces, we’ve added a new eligibility criteria that lets developers qualify without a stand-by letter of credit. For details, view the marketplace support page.\n\nApple is now giving developers a chance to change back to its standard terms, which means ditching the per-installation fee and returning to the higher commission rate. That offers a way out for app creators who rack up millions of downloads but can’t afford the fee — but only if they haven’t gone outside the App Store. While this should allow developers to test the waters with Apple’s new terms, it also arguably discourages developers from trying out alternative app stores, which undercuts a major goal of the DMA.\n\n“I believe that the concept of these new agreements... bears an uncanny resemblance to a mafia-like ultimatum to developers, essentially conveying, ‘Remember who’s in charge here, I’m your friend if you remember that; I’m willing to give you one more opportunity to stay with me,’” developer and author Maximiliano Firtman tells The Verge. “That new rule, along with most of the new regulations for publishing in EU countries, appears overly complex, potentially creating a significant barrier for developers, deterring them from even attempting to navigate these waters.”\n\nBut other developers see the update as a welcome change. “I think this will encourage more developers (especially indies) to adopt the terms just for the reduced App Store commission rate, because now they can ‘try it out’ and see whether they stay under the CTF [Core Technology fee] threshold,” AltStore developer Riley Testut says in an emailed statement to The Verge. “I don’t expect many developers to actually revert, but just knowing they can will give them the confidence to adopt the terms.”",

                        "newstext": "You can probably sum it all up in just one word: Barbenheimer.\n\nIt’s not a word found in Webster’s, but one that’s instantly recognizable to movie fans and everyone in all areas of the entertainment industry. Now it’s probably your key entry into the closing act of the very long Oscar season, one that started in earnest over Labor Day with the fall festivals at Venice and Telluride, and just a week later at Toronto. But really, this year got a significant start at Cannes with the debuts in May of Palme d’Or winner Anatomy of a Fall, Grand Prize winner The Zone of Interest, and the World Premiere of Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon.\n\nAll three of them have combined to claim 20 Oscar nominations and all are in the running for Best Picture. And then, shortly after Cannes, we had the one-two punch of Barbie and Oppenheimer both opening on July 21, in the heat of summer (not normally considered prime Oscar-bait timing) and between them managing 21 nominations including Best Picture.\n\nRELATED: How To Watch This Year’s Oscars Online And On TV: Don’t Forget About That Early Start\n\nA sixth Best Picture nominee, Past Lives, goes back even further, with its debut coming at the beginning of 2023 at Sundance. Only Poor Things, The Holdovers, American Fiction, and Maestro were first seen in the normally overcrowded Fall and Holiday corridor that has a habit of crowning Oscar winners. This year is an anomaly. But it also has turned out to be the first truly great crop of contenders since the pandemic.\n\nRELATED: Oscars Events And Parties Photos: Red Carpet Rollout & Governors Ball Preview Kicks Off Week\n\nHere then are my final FINAL predictions for winners of the 96th Annual Academy Awards. Keep in mind this is not one of those ‘will win/should win’ columns, not necessarily my personal votes but what I believe has the best chance to hit the stage at the Dolby Sunday night (or should I say Sunday afternoon since the show starts at 4pm PT). Win or not win however, all these nominees should be proud and thrilled to be there. This has been, against all odds, an exceptional year for movies. Best of luck in your Oscar pools.\n\nRELATED: Deadline’s Reviews Of All The Oscar Best Picture Nominees\n\nBEST PICTURE\n\nOppenheimer is the one to beat here. It has the most nominations with 13, which means the most overall support in an Academy where everyone now gets to vote on all 23 categories rather than just their branch and for Best Picture, which is the case in the nominations round. It also has gravitas: an important historical subject that also resonates in frightening ways for these times. Plus it made nearly a billion dollars worldwide, unheard of for a summer release of a three-hour adult drama that’s partially in black and white. There is also the Christopher Nolan factor, which is hard to deny—he‘s overdue. It has also swept key precursor awards at Golden Globes, Critics Choice, BAFTA, DGA, PGA, SAG and many crafts guilds making it an overwhelming front runner, probably in line to win 8 Oscars by my predictions.\n\nRELATED: All The Best Picture Oscar Winners – Photo Gallery\n\nBut should there be an upset it will likely be Poor Things, which has genuine fandom among some factions in the Academy and the second biggest number of nominations with 11, indicating heavy support. Searchlight’s magic touch won’t hurt here. But with the Academy’s weighted voting system for this category, some films like The Holdovers—which seems to be universally loved—could sneak in with a large number of No. 2 votes. Scorsese’s epic Killers of the Flower Moon has a strong 10 nominations here, but the omission of nominations for Adapted Screenplay and lead actor Leonardo DiCaprio could be a sign of trouble. The two foreign language nominees here are more likely to win elsewhere on Sunday night.\n\nTHE WINNER: Oppenheimer\n\nRELATED: 2024 Awards Season Calendar – Dates For Oscars, Guilds, Tonys & More\n\nFrom left: Paul Giamatti (The Holdovers), Colman Domingo (Rustin), Jeffrey Wright (American Fiction), Bradley Cooper (Maestro) and Cillian Murphy (Oppenheimer) Everett Collection\n\nBEST ACTOR\n\nThis race in surprisingly competitive with indicators from precursor events that we might have a real contest. Cillian Murphy took the Drama Actor Golden Globe, BAFTA, and SAG award for his performance in Oppenheimer, and it might be hard to deny this respected veteran on what — shockingly — is his first nomination. Then again, there’s Paul Giamatti, widely felt to have been robbed of even a nomination 20 years ago for Alexander Payne’s Sideways. Only having been in the race just once (for Supporting Actor in Cinderella Man), he also won a Golden Globe in the comedy category and then went on to beat Murphy in the often-predictive Critics Choice Awards.\n\nRELATED: Every Best Actor Oscar Winner Back To 1927\n\nThis is a very impressive category. Voters could also find love for Jeffrey Wright (American Fiction) and Colman Domingo (Rustin), both first-time nominees, or the spectacular work of Bradley Cooper, channeling Leonard Bernstein and who became only the fourth actor to direct himself to a nomination twice. Tough choices all around. But momentum as voting took place was clearly Murphy’s.\n\nTHE WINNER: Cillian Murphy, Oppenheimer\n\nFrom left: Emma Stone (Poor Things), Annette Bening (Nyad), Sandra Hüller (Anatomy of a Fall), Lily Gladstone (Killers of the Flower Moon) and Carey Mulligan (Maestro) Everett Collection\n\nBEST ACTRESS\n\nAnnette Bening has now been nominated five times and takes on the ridiculously overdue veteran-who-has-never-won mantle. Her work in Nyad is fearless, risky and astonishing, but that film is the only one in the category not nominated for Best Picture, so it is a hard mountain to climb (just ask Glenn Close). Interestingly though I have talked to several voters who tell me they cast their ballot for Bening despite the odds. Much has been made of the fact that Globe winner Gladstone is making history as the first Native American actress ever to be nominated in the category. She surprisingly wasn’t even nominated at BAFTA which could indicate trouble with the international voting block.\n\nRELATED: All The Oscar Best Actress Winners – Photo Gallery\n\nThat left a solid opening for another Globe winner (in Comedy) this year, Emma Stone, whose performance is widely felt to be the most original and inventive. She scored at BAFTA and Critics Choice, but Gladstone came back and too the all-important SAG award smack in the middle of Oscar voting. Still, Stone won just a few years ago and is still young. The international contingent could want to reward Hüller who is in two Best Picture nominees (Anatomy of A Fall and The Zone of Interest). Finally, as Meryl Streep noted in her Palm Spring Film Festival speech, Carey Mulligan’s exquisite supporting turn in Maestro is a gut-wrenching portrayal that should not be denied. It likely will, though, sadly. This one likely comes down to a coin toss between Gladstone and Stone. It could be either one, and if there is a split? Well, who knows?\n\nTHE WINNER: Emma Stone, Poor Things\n\nFrom left: Mark Ruffalo (Poor Things), Robert Downey Jr. (Oppenheimer), Ryan Gosling (Barbie), Robert De Niro (Killers of the Flower Moon) and Sterling K. Brown (American Fiction) Everett Collection\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTOR\n\nWhat a lineup this one is. It’s likely this is Globes, Critics Choice, SAG, and BAFTA winner Robert Downey Jr.’s to lose, especially since his speeches on the circuit following those many precursor wins have been completely winning themselves. It doesn’t hurt that he’s in Oppenheimer, the film likely to be hearing its name called many times on Oscar night. Downey, though, also has the personal story, the remarkable career survival against all odds, and he’s a genuinely nice guy whose time has come. Ryan Gosling was hilarious in Barbie, but comedy against highly dramatic performances often has a tougher time.\n\nRELATED: Every Best Supporting Actor Oscar Winner Back To 1937\n\nThis might also apply to Mark Ruffalo (Poor Things) who is well liked but also faces an uphill trek. Robert De Niro, a two-time winner and frequent nominee, won’t have enough juice to get over the top for Killers of the Flower Moon, although I would vote for him just to see him go politically ape like he did at the Gothams. Sterling K. Brown (American Fiction) is terrific, but the nomination is the win for him.\n\nTHE WINNER: Robert Downey Jr., Oppenheimer\n\nFrom left: America Ferrera (Barbie), Da’Vine Joy Randolph (The Holdovers), Jodie Foster (Nyad), Danielle Brooks (The Color Purple) and Emily Bunt (Oppenheimer) Everett Collection\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS\n\nIf you go by all the various award shows leading up to the Oscars, the victor here is obvious. Da’Vine Joy Randolph has been on a winning streak, with no losses for her wise and moving performance in The Holdovers, and I see no reason for it to stop at the Oscars. She is the overwhelming favorite at this point pulling off a rare complete sweep at all the precursors.\n\nRELATED: All The Oscar Supporting Actress Winners – Photo Gallery\n\nBut who can beat her? Blunt, criminally overlooked in the past and now with her first nomination can be helped by the huge haul for Oppenheimer. Nyad’s Jodie Foster, a two-time Best Actress winner, and Danielle Brooks, The Color Purple’s only nominee, stand little chance. America Ferrera’s stirring Barbie speech got her in this game, and the nomination was a terrific endorsement of her talents. But…\n\nTHE WINNER: Da’Vine Joy Randolph, The Holdovers\n\nThe Oppenheimer set Melinda Sue Gordon/Universal/Everett Collection\n\nBEST DIRECTOR\n\nThis one appears to be a lock for the ridiculously overdue Christopher Nolan, who did everything voters love with Oppenheimer. He took a big risk and proved to supporters and doubters that he is a true master of the form. He was outrageously overlooked for The Dark Knight in 2009, which prompted the Academy to double the number of Best Picture nominees the next year (presumably in a bid to avoid a repeat of that embarrassment). And though his films have won crafts awards, this is his time. Quite frankly, if he were to lose, it would be a shock. Of course, there is much love and respect for Scorsese and the challenge of making his first Western, and there is a trio of foreigners competing here too, showing the international bent of the branch. The consensus, though, is DGA, BAFTA, Globes, and Critics Choice winner Nolan.\n\nTHE WINNER: Christopher Nolan, Oppenheimer\n\nOppenheimer Melinda Sue Gordon/Universal Pictures/Everett Collection\n\nBEST CINEMATOGRAPHY\n\nThis race seems likely to come down to a couple of epics with 23 nominations overall between them: Hoyte van Hoytema’s Oppenheimer and Rodrigo Prieto’s Killers of the Flower Moon. Considering the latter is probably going to be a runner up in the Best Picture sweepstakes to the former, I am tempted to say this is a category where Scorsese’s important and authentic epic Western could be recognized. On the other hand, cinematography often goes to the Best Picture winner, though not always. Still, Van Hoytema’s Oppenheimer was stunning and took the ASC award last weekend. After losing on his first nomination for Nolan’s Dunkirk, this could be his year.\n\nTHE WINNER: Oppenheimer, Hoyte van Hoytema\n\nThe Zone of Interest A24/Everett Collection\n\nBEST INTERNATIONAL FILM\n\nIn all the instances in which a nominee in this category was also nominated in the Best Picture category, the winner was that film. Therefore, this is where you bet big in your Oscar pool and go for the only nominee that did that this year, The Zone of Interest, which would give the award to the U.K. in a rare move since the German-language Holocaust film comes from British director Jonathan Glazer. All the nominees are good here, but France’s failure to put forward their Cannes Palme d’Or winner, Anatomy of A Fall, in favor of the non-nominated The Taste of Things, means that unforced error has handed it to the Cannes (runner up) Grand Prize victor.\n\nTHE WINNER: The Zone of Interest (U.K.)\n\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Sony\n\nBEST ANIMATED FEATURE\n\nNeon’s pickup of Robot Dreams, a true charmer of a ’toon, was heartening, as was its inclusion here over higher profile possibilities like Disney’s Wish, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Dreams and The Super Mario Brothers Movie. So it is a victory itself. There is much love and respect for Hayao Miyazaki and what he calls his swan song with The Boy and the Heron, and it did indeed take the BAFTA and Golden Globe among a slew of critics’ prizes. Still, the year’s No. 3 grossing movie — the critically acclaimed sequel to a previous Oscar winner, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse — looks to be the rare follow-up to also go into glory again at the Academy Awards. Its sheer ambition and risk-taking with the animation art will likely be enough to overcome sentiment for Miyazaki.\n\nTHE WINNER: Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\n\nPoor Things Searchlight Pictures/Everett Collection\n\nBEST COSTUME DESIGN\n\nHolly Waddington’s imaginative styles for the wacky Poor Things vs Jacqueline Durran’s fashion-setting pinkness of Barbie? Or the stunning clothes from Napoleon vs the authentic and meticulous recreation of vintage Osage nation in Killers of the Flower Moon? Then there’s that hat that even managed to become a popular Halloween costume thanks to Oppenheimer. This is another toss-up category with many ways to go.\n\nTHE WINNER: Poor Things, Holly Waddington\n\nOppenheimer Melinda Sue Gordan/Universal Pictures/Everett Collection\n\nBEST FILM EDITING\n\nMore often than not, this category favors the Best Picture winner. This year it seems like a no-brainer for ACE Eddie and BAFTA winner Oppenheimer. Thelma Schoonmaker is always formidable, but some may wrongly think the three-and-a-half hour running time of Killers of the Flower Moon means it needed more editing. No — length isn’t a drawback in looking at the best edited films, and both of the above three hour-ish movies are prime candidates for truly the best.\n\nTHE WINNER: Oppenheimer, Jennifer Lame\n\nBarbie Lara Cornell/Warner Bros./Everett Collection\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SONG\n\nThis one is Barbie’s to lose — that movie might have had more than two nominations had the rules allowed it. So does it come down to Billie Eilish’ s Golden Globe, SCL, and Grammy winning Song of the Year “What Was I Made For?” Or is it the Critics Choice Awards-winning man anthem “I’m Just Ken,” with its showcase for Ryan Gosling and male chorus in the standout production number of any movie this year. Do they cancel each other out, allowing a long shot like Diane Warren’s “The Fire Inside” from Flamin’ Hot to finally give her the prize on her 15th nomination? Not likely. The same goes for Jon Batiste’s “It Never Went Away” from the documentary on his life, American Symphony. And despite making history, “Wahzhazhe (A Song for My People)” from Killers of the Flower Moon would be a shocker to actually win. So which Barbie tune makes it? Always bet on Eilish.\n\nTHE WINNER: “What Was I Made For?”, From Barbie,\n\nBillie Eilish and Finneas O’Connell\n\nOppenheimer Universal Pictures/Everett Collection\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SCORE\n\nLaura Karpman’s jazz stylings in American Fiction are a standout, and the veteran just got her first nomination here. Of course, you can never ignore John Williams (and the music branch didn’t), but he has no chance for this fifth and final Indiana Jones. First-time movie composer Jerskin Fendrik should be congratulated for landing a nomination this quickly for Poor Things. After all, it took Karpman a lot longer than that. However, none of them will likely win. It is between sentiment and a legacy score for the late Robbie Robertson’s Killers of the Flower Moon, and Black Panther Oscar winner Ludwig Goransson’s stunning, Grammy, BAFTA, and SCL-winning Oppenheimer.\n\nTHE WINNER: Oppenheimer, Ludwig Goransson\n\nPoor Things\n\nBEST PRODUCTION DESIGN\n\nBarbie’s toy world really stands on its own here, simply as something so eye-poppingly fun to behold. It screams production design, but then so does the bizarre fantasy world of BAFTA winner Poor Things, which is every bit as dazzling. Then there is the stunning epic-ness of Napoleon, the authentic and stunning recreation of the Osage nation circa 100 years ago in Killers of the Flower Moon, and the intricate recreations of Oppenheimer. For me this is one of the most difficult categories to call. If you spend any time watching the behind-the-scenes interviews with all the artisans who created these wildly different worlds, you would probably call it a five-way tie. Flip a coin here.\n\nTHE WINNER: Poor Things , Shana Heath, James Price, Zsuzsa Mihalek\n\nMaestro Netflix\n\nBEST MAKEUP AND HAIRSTYLING\n\nGolda is a well-chosen nominee here, and the makeup is also a reminder that its star Helen Mirren was robbed of a much-deserved Best Actress nomination. Maybe we honor the artisans who created the look for the woman who acted it so magnificently. Personally, I would say they could win just for that, but there are two Best Picture nominees here more likely to battle this one out: Maestro, from that maestro of prosthetic makeup Kazu Hiro, and BAFTA winner Poor Things.\n\nTHE WINNER: Maestro, Kazu Hiro, Kay Georgious and Lori McCoy-Bell\n\nAmerican Fiction MGM/Everett Collection\n\nBEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY\n\nOK, so can this be a way the Academy makes it up to Greta Gerwig for the unfair snub in Best Director and give it to her and Noah Baumbach for their wildly successful and original Barbie — even though the writers branch has made it more difficult by putting it in a category of stiff competition from Nolan’s Oppenheimer, Tony McNamara’s sharp Poor Things, and (one that should not be underrated) Cord Jefferson’s crowd-pleasing satire American Fiction which since I made my initial prediction for it in this category has gone on to win at BAFTA, USA Scripter, Critics Choice, and Indie Spirits. Therefore I would not be surprised at all to see that one sneak in here. Although a writing award usually goes to a Best Picture winner, indicating a victory for Nolan here, I think this is where a consolation prize may be given. I am tempted more than ever now to give it to the one nominated film that’s actually about writing.\n\nTHE WINNER: American Fiction, Cord Jefferson\n\nRELATED: The Script’s The Thing: Read All Of This Year’s Oscar-Nominated Screenplays\n\nAnatomy of a Fall Neon/Everett Collection\n\nBEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY\n\nIf you ask me, this is the category where Barbie belongs — had it not been the victim of arcane academy rules that say it was adapted (unlike WGA which labeled it original) it might have won. At any rate, its absence here has opened up other possibilities, particularly for Golden Globe winner Anatomy of a Fall, which could be the first French screenplay to win here since A Man and A Woman in 1966. Stiff competition comes from the much-loved The Holdovers. It appears to be a contest primarily between Justine Triet for Anatomy, which could be celebrated here as a show of support for a Palme d’Or winner controversially not selected as her country’s international entry, and David Hemingson’s moving and funny dramedy, The Holdovers. The spoiler here could be Celine Song’s Past Lives, but it has only two nominations — yet one of them is Best Picture.\n\nTHE WINNER: Anatomy of a Fall, Justine Triet\n\nOppenheimer Universal Pictures/Everett Collection\n\nBEST SOUND\n\nOppenheimer probably takes this one, but formidable competition comes from the magnificent musical sound achieved in Maestro. But did voters see this Netflix film in a theater where the sound work really shines? There is also subtle work in BAFTA winner The Zone of Interest, perhaps too subtle for voters who don’t really know what goes into sound design in the first place. The other candidates are just what you would expect here, big and loud. If Oppenheimer does win, it would mean the second Oscar for 22-time nominee, Kevin O’Connell, once known as the Susan Lucci of the Oscars.\n\nTHE WINNER: Oppenheimer\n\nGodzilla Minus One Toho International/Everett Collection\n\nBEST VISUAL EFFECTS\n\nInterestingly, the movie that would have been the easy winner here, Oppenheimer, didn’t even make the top 20 finalists. Go figure. Branch members might have resented talk that Nolan shot so much of it in camera that it didn’t leave much for the effects wizards. Consensus is the stunning work in the A.I. sci fi epic, The Creator is best in show here, particularly all its wins from the Visual Effects awards group. The film’s only problem will be in getting the bulk of Academy voters to actually watch it, since it was not a huge boxoffice hit. The one I would look at as possibly the upset of all time is Godzilla Minus One, Toho International’s return to the feel and budget of their older Godzilla movies, a marvelously inventive use of effects with a tenth of the cost of the others. The movie was a hit, but did voters see it? Hope so.\n\nTHE WINNER: Godzilla Minus One\n\n20 Days in Mariupol Courtesy Sundance Film Festival\n\nBEST DOCUMENTARY FEATURE\n\nThe shocking thing about this category is the films that aren’t in it. No Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie. No American Symphony. Once again documentary branch voters show they don’t love docs about showbusiness (and maybe don’t love seeing their choices sweep the Emmys like Still did while ballots were still out). This is a pretty heavy bunch to choose from. Bobi Wine: The People’s President is the most upbeat and hopeful of a very international list of contenders — not a single American picture in the bunch. Because of its Ukraine war themes though, the harrowing 20 Days in Mariupol could have the edge, especially since last year voters went for another anti-Putin film, Navalny which due to the death of its subject is once again front of mind. So is Ukraine with increasingly dire forecasts for its future.\n\nTHE WINNER: 20 Days in Mariupol\n\nThe Last Repair Shop Breakwater Studios/LA Times Studios/Searchlight Pictures\n\nBEST DOCUMENTARY SHORT\n\nThis is a terrific category, with at least three films that could come out on top. The powerful yet simple The ABC’S of Book Banning, the equally strong and eye-opening The Barber of Little Rock, and the stirring and lovely The Last Repair Shop (from Ben Proudfoot and Kris Bowers) could all win, depending on voters’ moods. The former pair focus on burning issues and social justice, while the latter is a moving, musical and a winning look at an operation that brings damaged instruments back to life and then sends them to schools where they live to play another day. Charming as it is as it is in chronicling the friendship of two Taiwanese grandmas, Nai Nai & Wài Pó is probably to light to win, and another, heavier, Taiwan-related doc, Island In Between is fine, but it doesn’t stay with you like the frontrunners.\n\nTHE WINNER: The Last Repair Shop\n\nWar Is Over! Inspired by the Music of John and Yoko ElectroLeague/Everett Collection\n\nBEST ANIMATED SHORT\n\nAn eclectic set of contenders here. Our Uniform is a six minute ‘toon about the plight of females in Iran as related to their fashion restrictions, and Letter To A Pig is powerful, striking, and quite weird, not your father’s Babe. Emotionally neither was easy to embrace due to their abstract animation. On the other hand the French Pachyderme blends gorgeous animation to tell the story of a young girl’s visit with her grandfather. Ninety-Five Senses from Jerusha and Jared Hess is for me just fantastic as it is narrated by an older man as he tells the story of his life through the five senses, twisting into an amusing, and then quite dramatic tale that takes you to unexpected places. It is original and brilliantly animated, with a great vocal performance by Tim Blake Nelson. However best in show here is the inventive, moving, enriching, and quite wonderful War Is Over! Inspired by the Music of John & Yoko. Sean Lennon and Yoko Ono are even executive producers for this memorable film that is a must-see, especially for these times.\n\nTHE WINNER: War Is Over! Inspired by the Music of John & Yoko\n\nKnight of Fortune The New Yorker\n\nBEST LIVE ACTION SHORT\n\nHere we have two films dealing with men grieving the death of their wives, another about mental illness involving a teen, one about the problems getting an abortion, and one showcasing Wes Anderson doing, well, Wes Anderson. The starriest is the latter film, in which Anderson’s unmistakable style takes on Roald Dahl’s whimsical short story, The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar with Benedict Cumberbatch, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes telling it. Those reasons, not to mention its prominent Venice Film Festival debut, probably makes it the frontrunner although some have expressed disapproval of seeing smaller films compete against the oft Oscar-nominated Anderson (yet still to win) and his famous cast in a category designed for filmmakers who might otherwise not be recognized. Of the two films dealing with grief, The After provides David Oyelowo with a rich and emotional role, and the superb Danish Knight of Fortune has some marvelous deadpan acting from two excellent thesps and a twist I didn’t see coming. And then there is Red, White and Blue which stars Brittany Snow, a surprising and very powerful abortion story that truly stuns and enlightens — a must-see film that’s especially topical in light of the recent overturning of Roe v Wade, an act by the Supreme Court that inspired it. This category could provide a real upset. I call it a toss-up, but when in doubt I go for the most emotional, so perhaps a real longshot.\n\nTHE WINNER: Knight of Fortune\n\nRELATED: 2024 Oscar Presenters: The Full List\n\nRELATED: Oscars Street Closures For Red Carpet, Telecast & More – See The Maps",

Keep in mind this is not one of those &#8216;will win/should win&#8217; columns, not necessarily my personal votes but what I believe has the best chance to hit the stage at the Dolby Sunday night (or should I say Sunday afternoon since the show starts at 4pm PT). Win or not win however, all these nominees should be proud and thrilled to be there. This has been, against all odds, an exceptional year for movies. Best of luck in your Oscar pools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\t<a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/01/2024-oscars-best-picture-nominees-reviews-1235802478\"><strong>RELATED: Deadline&#8217;s Reviews Of All The Oscar Best Picture Nominees</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\t<strong>BEST PICTURE</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\tOppenheimer is the one to beat here. It has the most nominations with 13, which means the most overall support in an Academy where everyone now gets to vote on all 23 categories rather than just their branch and for Best Picture, which is the case in the nominations round. It also has gravitas: an important historical subject that also resonates in frightening ways for these times. Plus it made nearly a billion dollars worldwide, unheard of for a summer release of a three-hour adult drama that&#8217;s partially in black and white. There is also the Christopher Nolan factor, which is hard to deny&#8212;he&#8216;s overdue. It has also swept key precursor awards at Golden Globes, Critics Choice, BAFTA, DGA, PGA, SAG and many crafts guilds making it an overwhelming front runner, probably in line to win 8 Oscars by my predictions.\n\n\t</p><p id=\"gpt-dl-mid-article-inject2-uid1\" class=\" adw-1 adh-1\">\n\t\t \n\t</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\t<a href=\"https://deadline.com/gallery/oscars-best-picture-winners/\"><strong>RELATED:</strong></a><a href=\"https://deadline.com/feature/awards-season-calendar-oscars-emmys-golden-globes-list-1234814076/\"><strong> </strong></a><strong>All The Best Picture Oscar Winners &#8211; Photo Gallery</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\tBut should there be an upset it will likely be Poor Things, which has genuine fandom among some factions in the Academy and the second biggest number of nominations with 11, indicating heavy support. Searchlight&#8217;s magic touch won&#8217;t hurt here. But with the Academy&#8217;s weighted voting system for this category, some films like The Holdovers&#8212;which seems to be universally loved&#8212;could sneak in with a large number of No. 2 votes. Scorsese&#8217;s epic Killers of the Flower Moon has a strong 10 nominations here, but the omission of nominations for Adapted Screenplay and lead actor Leonardo DiCaprio could be a sign of trouble. The two foreign language nominees here are more likely to win elsewhere on Sunday night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\t<strong>THE WINNER:</strong>&#160;Oppenheimer</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\t<strong><a href=\"https://deadline.com/feature/awards-season-calendar-oscars-emmys-golden-globes-list-1234814076/\">RELATED: 2024 Awards Season Calendar &#8211; Dates For Oscars, Guilds, Tonys &amp; More</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n<img class=\"c-lazy-image__img lrv-u-background-color-grey-lightest lrv-u-width-100p lrv-u-display-block lrv-u-height-auto\" src=\"https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg\" alt=\"Best Actor Oscars\" height=\"577\" width=\"1024\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\" lrv-u-font-size-16 lrv-u-font-size-14@mobile-max lrv-a-font-body-m u-font-style-italic lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-font-family-primary u-line-height-20 u-letter-spacing-0 u-line-height-18@mobile-max\">From left: Paul Giamatti (The Holdovers), Colman Domingo (Rustin), Jeffrey Wright (American Fiction), Bradley Cooper (Maestro) and Cillian Murphy (Oppenheimer)</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEverett Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\t<strong><a href=\"https://deadline.com/tag/best-actor/\" id=\"auto-tag_best-actor\">BEST ACTOR</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\tThis race in surprisingly competitive with indicators from precursor events that we might have a real contest. Cillian Murphy took the Drama Actor Golden Globe, BAFTA, and SAG award for his performance in Oppenheimer, and it might be hard to deny this respected veteran on what &#8212; shockingly &#8212; is his first nomination. Then again, there&#8217;s Paul Giamatti, widely felt to have been robbed of even a nomination 20 years ago for Alexander Payne&#8217;s Sideways. Only having been in the race just once (for Supporting Actor in Cinderella Man), he also won a Golden Globe in the comedy category and then went on to beat Murphy in the often-predictive Critics Choice Awards. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\t<a href=\"https://deadline.com/gallery/oscars-best-actor-winners-2/\"><strong></strong><strong>RELATED:</strong></a><a href=\"https://deadline.com/feature/awards-season-calendar-oscars-emmys-golden-globes-list-1234814076/\"><strong> </strong></a>Every Best Actor Oscar Winner Back To 1927</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\tThis is a very impressive category.

Her work in Nyad is fearless, risky and astonishing, but that film is the only one in the category not nominated for Best Picture, so it is a hard mountain to climb (just ask Glenn Close). Interestingly though I have talked to several voters who tell me they cast their ballot for Bening despite the odds. Much has been made of the fact that Globe winner Gladstone is making history as the first Native American actress ever to be nominated in the category. She surprisingly wasn&#8217;t even nominated at BAFTA which could indicate trouble with the international voting block. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\t<a href=\"https://deadline.com/gallery/oscars-best-actress-winners/\"><strong></strong><strong>RELATED:</strong></a><a href=\"https://deadline.com/feature/awards-season-calendar-oscars-emmys-golden-globes-list-1234814076/\"><strong> </strong></a>All The Oscar Best Actress Winners &#8211; Photo Gallery</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\tThat left a solid opening for another Globe winner (in Comedy) this year, Emma Stone, whose performance is widely felt to be the most original and inventive. She scored at BAFTA and Critics Choice, but Gladstone came back and too the all-important SAG award smack in the middle of Oscar voting. Still, Stone won just a few years ago and is still young. The international contingent could want to reward H&#252;ller who is in two Best Picture nominees (Anatomy of A Fall and The Zone of Interest). Finally, as Meryl Streep noted in her Palm Spring Film Festival speech, Carey Mulligan&#8217;s exquisite supporting turn in Maestro is a gut-wrenching portrayal that should not be denied. It likely will, though, sadly. This one likely comes down to a coin toss between Gladstone and Stone. It could be either one, and if there is a split?

It doesn&#8217;t hurt that he&#8217;s in Oppenheimer, the film likely to be hearing its name called many times on Oscar night. Downey, though, also has the personal story, the remarkable career survival against all odds, and he&#8217;s a genuinely nice guy whose time has come.

He took a big risk and proved to supporters and doubters that he is a true master of the form. He was outrageously overlooked for The Dark Knight in 2009, which prompted the Academy to double the number of Best Picture nominees the next year (presumably in a bid to avoid a repeat of that embarrassment). And though his films have won crafts awards, this is his time. Quite frankly, if he were to lose, it would be a shock. Of course, there is much love and respect for Scorsese and the challenge of making his first Western, and there is a trio of foreigners competing here too, showing the international bent of the branch. The consensus, though, is DGA, BAFTA, Globes, and Critics Choice winner Nolan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\t<strong>THE WINNER:</strong>&#160;Christopher Nolan, Oppenheimer</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n<img class=\"c-lazy-image__img lrv-u-background-color-grey-lightest lrv-u-width-100p lrv-u-display-block lrv-u-height-auto\" src=\"https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg\" alt=\"Oppenheimer Oscars\" height=\"682\" width=\"1024\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\" lrv-u-font-size-16 lrv-u-font-size-14@mobile-max lrv-a-font-body-m u-font-style-italic lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-font-family-primary u-line-height-20 u-letter-spacing-0 u-line-height-18@mobile-max\">Oppenheimer</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMelinda Sue Gordon/Universal Pictures/Everett Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\t<strong>BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY</strong>\n\n\t</p><p id=\"gpt-dsk-tab-mid-articleX-uid3\" class=\" adw-1 adh-1\">\n\t\t \n\t</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\tThis race seems likely to come down to a couple of epics with 23 nominations overall between them: Hoyte van Hoytema&#8217;s Oppenheimer and Rodrigo Prieto&#8217;s Killers of the Flower Moon. Considering the latter is probably going to be a runner up in the Best Picture sweepstakes to the former, I am tempted to say this is a category where Scorsese&#8217;s important and authentic epic Western could be recognized. On the other hand, cinematography often goes to the Best Picture winner, though not always. Still, Van Hoytema&#8217;s Oppenheimer was stunning and took the ASC award last weekend.

All the nominees are good here, but France&#8217;s failure to put forward their Cannes Palme d&#8217;Or winner, Anatomy of A Fall, in favor of the non-nominated The Taste of Things, means that unforced error has handed it to the Cannes (runner up) Grand Prize victor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\t<strong>THE WINNER:</strong> The Zone of Interest (U.K.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n<img class=\"c-lazy-image__img lrv-u-background-color-grey-lightest lrv-u-width-100p lrv-u-display-block lrv-u-height-auto\" src=\"https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg\" alt=\"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Oscars\" height=\"419\" width=\"1000\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\" lrv-u-font-size-16 lrv-u-font-size-14@mobile-max lrv-a-font-body-m u-font-style-italic lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-font-family-primary u-line-height-20 u-letter-spacing-0 u-line-height-18@mobile-max\">Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSony\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\t<strong>BEST ANIMATED FEATURE</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\tNeon&#8217;s pickup of Robot Dreams, a true charmer of a &#8217;toon, was heartening, as was its inclusion here over higher profile possibilities like Disney&#8217;s Wish, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Dreams and The Super Mario Brothers Movie. So it is a victory itself. There is much love and respect for Hayao Miyazaki and what he calls his swan song with The Boy and the Heron, and it did indeed take the BAFTA and Golden Globe among a slew of critics&#8217; prizes. Still, the year&#8217;s No. 3 grossing movie &#8212; the critically acclaimed sequel to a previous Oscar winner, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse &#8212; looks to be the rare follow-up to also go into glory again at the Academy Awards.

Although a writing award usually goes to a Best Picture winner, indicating a victory for Nolan here, I think this is where a consolation prize may be given. I am tempted more than ever now to give it to the one nominated film that&#8217;s actually about writing.\n\n\t</p><p id=\"gpt-dsk-tab-mid-articleX-uid5\" class=\" adw-1 adh-1\">\n\t\t \n\t</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\t<strong>THE WINNER:</strong>&#160;American Fiction, Cord Jefferson</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\t<a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/03/oscar-nominated-screenplays-2024-scripts-1235802192/\"><strong>RELATED: The Script&#8217;s The Thing: Read All Of This Year&#8217;s Oscar-Nominated Screenplays</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n<img class=\"c-lazy-image__img lrv-u-background-color-grey-lightest lrv-u-width-100p lrv-u-display-block lrv-u-height-auto\" src=\"https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg\" alt=\"Anatomy of a Fall\" height=\"593\" width=\"1024\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\" lrv-u-font-size-16 lrv-u-font-size-14@mobile-max lrv-a-font-body-m u-font-style-italic lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-font-family-primary u-line-height-20 u-letter-spacing-0 u-line-height-18@mobile-max\">Anatomy of a Fall</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNeon/Everett Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\t<strong>BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\tIf you ask me, this is the category where Barbie belongs &#8212; had it not been the victim of arcane academy rules that say it was adapted (unlike WGA which labeled it original) it might have won. At any rate, its absence here has opened up other possibilities, particularly for Golden Globe winner Anatomy of a Fall, which could be the first French screenplay to win here since A Man and A Woman in 1966. Stiff competition comes from the much-loved The Holdovers. It appears to be a contest primarily between Justine Triet for Anatomy, which could be celebrated here as a show of support for a Palme d&#8217;Or winner controversially not selected as her country&#8217;s international entry, and David Hemingson&#8217;s moving and funny dramedy, The Holdovers.

But did voters see this Netflix film in a theater where the sound work really shines? There is also subtle work in BAFTA winner The Zone of Interest, perhaps too subtle for voters who don&#8217;t really know what goes into sound design in the first place. The other candidates are just what you would expect here, big and loud. If Oppenheimer does win, it would mean the second Oscar for 22-time nominee, Kevin O&#8217;Connell, once known as the Susan Lucci of the Oscars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\t<strong>THE WINNER:</strong>&#160;Oppenheimer</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n<img class=\"c-lazy-image__img lrv-u-background-color-grey-lightest lrv-u-width-100p lrv-u-display-block lrv-u-height-auto\" src=\"https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg\" alt=\"Godzilla Minus One Oscars\" height=\"575\" width=\"1024\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\" lrv-u-font-size-16 lrv-u-font-size-14@mobile-max lrv-a-font-body-m u-font-style-italic lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-font-family-primary u-line-height-20 u-letter-spacing-0 u-line-height-18@mobile-max\">Godzilla Minus One</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tToho International/Everett Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\t<strong>BEST VISUAL EFFECTS</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\tInterestingly, the movie that would have been the easy winner here, Oppenheimer, didn&#8217;t even make the top 20 finalists. Go figure. Branch members might have resented talk that Nolan shot so much of it in camera that it didn&#8217;t leave much for the effects wizards. Consensus is the stunning work in the A.I. sci fi epic, The Creator is best in show here, particularly all its wins from the Visual Effects awards group. The film&#8217;s only problem will be in getting the bulk of Academy voters to actually watch it, since it was not a huge boxoffice hit. The one I would look at as possibly the upset of all time is Godzilla Minus One, Toho International&#8217;s return to the feel and budget of their older Godzilla movies, a marvelously inventive use of effects with a tenth of the cost of the others. The movie was a hit, but did voters see it?

No Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie. No American Symphony. Once again documentary branch voters show they don&#8217;t love docs about showbusiness (and maybe don&#8217;t love seeing their choices sweep the Emmys like Still did while ballots were still out). This is a pretty heavy bunch to choose from. Bobi Wine: The People&#8217;s President is the most upbeat and hopeful of a very international list of contenders &#8212; not a single American picture in the bunch. Because of its Ukraine war themes though, the harrowing 20 Days in Mariupol could have the edge, especially since last year voters went for another anti-Putin film, Navalny which due to the death of its subject is once again front of mind. So is Ukraine with increasingly dire forecasts for its future.\n\n\t</p><p id=\"gpt-dsk-tab-mid-articleX-uid6\" class=\" adw-1 adh-1\">\n\t\t \n\t</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\t<strong>THE WINNER:</strong>&#160;20 Days in Mariupol</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n<img class=\"c-lazy-image__img lrv-u-background-color-grey-lightest lrv-u-width-100p lrv-u-display-block lrv-u-height-auto\" src=\"https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg\" alt=\"The Last Repair Shop Oscars\" height=\"576\" width=\"1024\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\" lrv-u-font-size-16 lrv-u-font-size-14@mobile-max lrv-a-font-body-m u-font-style-italic lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-font-family-primary u-line-height-20 u-letter-spacing-0 u-line-height-18@mobile-max\">The Last Repair Shop</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBreakwater Studios/LA Times Studios/Searchlight Pictures\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\t<strong>BEST DOCUMENTARY SHORT</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\tThis is a terrific category, with at least three films that could come out on top. The powerful yet simple The ABC&#8217;S of Book Banning, the equally strong and eye-opening The Barber of Little Rock, and the stirring and lovely The Last Repair Shop (from Ben Proudfoot and Kris Bowers) could all win, depending on voters&#8217; moods. The former pair focus on burning issues and social justice, while the latter is a moving, musical and a winning look at an operation that brings damaged instruments back to life and then sends them to schools where they live to play another day. Charming as it is as it is in chronicling the friendship of two Taiwanese grandmas, Nai Nai &amp; W&#224;i P&#243; is probably to light to win, and another, heavier, Taiwan-related doc, Island In Between is fine, but it doesn&#8217;t stay with you like the frontrunners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\t<strong>THE WINNER:</strong> The Last Repair Shop</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n<img class=\"c-lazy-image__img lrv-u-background-color-grey-lightest lrv-u-width-100p lrv-u-display-block lrv-u-height-auto\" src=\"https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg\" alt=\"War is Over Oscars\" height=\"409\" width=\"1024\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\" lrv-u-font-size-16 lrv-u-font-size-14@mobile-max lrv-a-font-body-m u-font-style-italic lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-font-family-primary u-line-height-20 u-letter-spacing-0 u-line-height-18@mobile-max\">War Is Over!

Our Uniform is a six minute &#8216;toon about the plight of females in Iran as related to their fashion restrictions, and Letter To A Pig is powerful, striking, and quite weird, not your father&#8217;s Babe. Emotionally neither was easy to embrace due to their abstract animation. On the other hand the French Pachyderme blends gorgeous animation to tell the story of a young girl&#8217;s visit with her grandfather. Ninety-Five Senses from Jerusha and Jared Hess is for me just fantastic as it is narrated by an older man as he tells the story of his life through the five senses, twisting into an amusing, and then quite dramatic tale that takes you to unexpected places. It is original and brilliantly animated, with a great vocal performance by Tim Blake Nelson. However best in show here is the inventive, moving, enriching, and quite wonderful War Is Over!

Sean Lennon and Yoko Ono are even executive producers for this memorable film that is a must-see, especially for these times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\t<strong>THE WINNER:</strong>&#160;War Is Over!

The starriest is the latter film, in which Anderson&#8217;s unmistakable style takes on Roald Dahl&#8217;s whimsical short story, The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar with Benedict Cumberbatch, Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes telling it. Those reasons, not to mention its prominent Venice Film Festival debut, probably makes it the frontrunner although some have expressed disapproval of seeing smaller films compete against the oft Oscar-nominated Anderson (yet still to win) and his famous cast in a category designed for filmmakers who might otherwise not be recognized. Of the two films dealing with grief, The After provides David Oyelowo with a rich and emotional role, and the superb Danish Knight of Fortune has some marvelous deadpan acting from two excellent thesps and a twist I didn&#8217;t see coming. And then there is Red, White and Blue which stars Brittany Snow, a surprising and very powerful abortion story that truly stuns and enlightens &#8212; a must-see film that&#8217;s especially topical in light of the recent overturning of Roe v Wade, an act by the Supreme Court that inspired it. This category could provide a real upset. I call it a toss-up, but when in doubt I go for the most emotional, so perhaps a real longshot.\n\n\t</p><p id=\"gpt-dsk-tab-mid-articleX-uid7\" class=\" adw-1 adh-1\">\n\t\t \n\t</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\t<strong>THE WINNER:</strong> Knight of Fortune</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\t<a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/03/oscars-2024-presenters-list-1235838618/\"><strong>RELATED: 2024 Oscar Presenters: The Full List</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\t<a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/02/oscar-street-closure-maps-1235842092/\"><strong>RELATED: Oscars Street Closures For Red Carpet, Telecast &amp; More &#8211; See The Maps</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t</div>",

                        "newstext": "It's not a question of if \"Oppenheimer\" will win an Academy Award on Sunday. It's more whether director Christopher Nolan will need a little red wagon or a Brinks truck to carry home all the golden treasures.\n\nWith a leading 13 nominations, Nolan's atomic bomb thriller rolls into the 96th Oscars ceremony (airing live on ABC, 7 p.m. EDT/4 PDT) as a heavy favorite to pick up some serious hardware, from below-the-line categories to the big-deal races like best actor, supporting actor and picture. At least best actress could be interesting, with previous winner Emma Stone (\"Poor Things\") vs. newcomer Lily Gladstone (\"Killers of the Flower Moon\") for all the marbles.\n\nWhile we root for enough chaos to keep the night interesting, here are our predictions for all the major categories:\n\nBest picture\n\n\"American Fiction\"\n\n\"Anatomy of a Fall\"\n\n\"Barbie\"\n\n\"The Holdovers\"\n\n\"Killers of the Flower Moon\"\n\n\"Maestro\"\n\n\"Oppenheimer\"\n\n\"Past Lives\"\n\n\"Poor Things\"\n\n\"The Zone of Interest\"\n\nWill win: \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nShould win: \"Barbie\"\n\n\"Oppenheimer\" digs into America's past but it also has awards-season history on its side: Nolan's film won top prizes from the directors, producers and actors guilds, and only one movie, 1995's \"Apollo 13,\" has taken those and not also won best picture. So barring one of the biggest Oscar upsets ever, \"Oppy\" has this in the bag − although the Oscars' preferential ballot, where voters rank their top choices, at least presents the possibility for a surprise. And if \"Barbie\" has a chance, we're going for it, because while \"Oppenheimer\" is definitely a filmmaking feat, Greta Gerwig's fun, pink-washed phenomenon feels more of our time with its gender dynamics and existential themes.\n\nBest actress\n\nAnnette Bening, \"Nyad\"\n\nLily Gladstone, \"Killers of the Flower Moon\"\n\nSandra Hüller, \"Anatomy of a Fall\"\n\nCarey Mulligan, \"Maestro\"\n\nEmma Stone, \"Poor Things\"\n\nWill win: Gladstone\n\nShould win: Hüller\n\nQuality wins by Stone and Gladstone throughout this awards season have made this somewhat of a toss-up: Both snagged Golden Globes, Stone was victorious at Critics Choice and BAFTA (where Gladstone wasn't in the race), but Gladstone has the Oscar edge, given her recent Screen Actors Guild trophy. (The Oscar winner has differed from the SAG victor only three times in the past 13 years.) Both are terrific, though instead of zigging, let's secretly hope for a big zag because Hüller powers every scene of courtroom drama \"Anatomy of a Fall\" with mystery and magnetism.\n\nBest actor\n\nBradley Cooper, \"Maestro\"\n\nColman Domingo, \"Rustin\"\n\nPaul Giamatti, \"The Holdovers\"\n\nCillian Murphy, \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nJeffrey Wright, \"American Fiction\"\n\nWill win: Murphy\n\nShould win: Wright\n\nAs the intriguing man behind the bomb, Murphy has rolled through Oscar season and there's no stopping him now, between a searingly great, complex performance and heavy-duty \"Oppenheimer\" momentum. Fellow first-timer Wright will no doubt be back in the hunt at some point, but his \"Fiction\" role just suits everything he does well. As a fiery academic dealing with unsuspecting success, Wright out-curmudgeons the mighty Giamatti, gives an irascible grump a big heart, and, as one of our great character actors, makes the most of his spotlight.\n\nBest supporting actress\n\nEmily Blunt, \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nDanielle Brooks, \"The Color Purple\"\n\nAmerica Ferrera, \"Barbie\"\n\nJodie Foster, \"Nyad\"\n\nDa'Vine Joy Randolph, \"The Holdovers\"\n\nWill win/should win: Randolph\n\nRandolph has run the table toward the Oscars, and she'll be grabbing the glory on Sunday night too. As well she should for such a stunning turn. Following appearances in \"Dolemite Is My Name\" and \"The United States vs. Billie Holiday,\" Randolph is both entertaining and heartbreaking as Mary Lamb. She's the tough-love head cook of a boarding school who forms a mini-family with a crusty professor (Giamatti) and rebellious student (Dominic Sessa) while also navigating the absolute grief of the first Christmas without her beloved son.\n\nBest supporting actor\n\nSterling K. Brown, \"American Fiction\"\n\nRobert De Niro, \"Killers of the Flower Moon\"\n\nRobert Downey Jr., \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nRyan Gosling, \"Barbie\"\n\nMark Ruffalo, \"Poor Things\"\n\nWill win/should win: Downey\n\nHe's had box-office success, and his share of ups and downs, but Downey doesn't have an Oscar. That changes Sunday, when he'll clean up at one last awards show and (hopefully) say something interesting with a live mic. He's deserving from a career \"attaboy\" sense but also from the fact that, after playing a superhero for more than a decade, Downey proved he's great at being an antagonist. As Lewis Strauss, he puts Murphy's J. Robert Oppenheimer through a stressful wringer born of power and pettiness, and in a movie that leans bleak, it's satisfying to witness the ultimate comeuppance.\n\nBest director\n\nJustine Triet, \"Anatomy of a Fall\"\n\nMartin Scorsese, \"Killers of the Flower Moon\"\n\nChristopher Nolan, \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nYorgos Lanthimos, \"Poor Things\"\n\nJonathan Glazer, \"The Zone of Interest\"\n\nWill win/should win: Nolan\n\nAkin to Scorsese's 2007 win for \"The Departed,\" it's just Nolan's time. While he's only garnered two directing nominations (plus three for best picture, two for original screenplay, one for adapted screenplay), Nolan's filmmaking acumen is on screen for all to see with \"Oppenheimer\" – the Trinity test alone is breathtaking. But he's carved out an excellent populist filmography for himself, from \"The Dark Knight\" and \"Memento\" to \"Inception\" and \"Interstellar,\" and it's an achievement in itself to create a blockbuster hit out of a dense, three-hour drama about scientists.",

                        "newstext": "In some sense, this has been the most boring Oscar campaign in years. The minute Oppenheimer blew past all expectations to become a critical and commercial smash, it seemed clear it would be an Academy Awards front-runner. Through the long and complicated slog of awards season, that prediction has largely come true: Christopher Nolan’s J. Robert Oppenheimer biopic has been a juggernaut, collecting Golden Globes, BAFTAs, and guild and critics’ awards on its way to an expected Best Picture triumph.\n\nBut the expected dominance of Oppenheimer is merely an obvious conclusion to a night that may still surprise, particularly in the lead-acting categories and the two screenplay awards. As Hollywood gathers to celebrate a fraught but exciting year for cinema, with hits such as Barbie and critical sensations such as Killers of the Flower Moon also up for a slew of prizes, which categories will provide the best chances for a shocking result? Here are my predictions.\n\nBest Actress\n\nNominees: Annette Bening (Nyad), Lily Gladstone (Killers of the Flower Moon), Sandra Hüller (Anatomy of a Fall), Carey Mulligan (Maestro), Emma Stone (Poor Things)\n\nThis is probably the most fluid Oscar race, with Gladstone seen as a slight favorite going into the final days. Her arresting work in Martin Scorsese’s epic has been the subject of a little category confusion—her character, Mollie, is central to the plot but goes missing for a good chunk, as she’s bedridden by a conspiratorial plot to kill her. Some industry experts thought Gladstone might try the supporting category, but she was wise to shoot for the lead, given that Mollie is the heart of the movie. Should Gladstone take home the prize, she would be the first Native American actor to win an acting Oscar—a huge milestone. Her main competition is Stone, whose extremely physical comedic masterclass in Poor Things would be a winner in many a year. But Stone already has an Oscar for 2017’s La La Land, and voters may be reluctant to award her another trophy so soon. Bening and Mulligan are both beloved multiple-time nominees, but both of their movies had more committed detractors, while Hüller’s complex work in Anatomy of a Fall is sure to have passionate but not widespread support.\n\nWho Will Win: Lily Gladstone\n\nWho Ought to Win: Lily Gladstone\n\nBest Actor\n\nNominees: Bradley Cooper (Maestro), Colman Domingo (Rustin), Paul Giamatti (The Holdovers), Cillian Murphy (Oppenheimer), Jeffrey Wright (American Fiction)\n\nDespite appearing in almost every frame of Oppenheimer, Murphy was a perpetual underdog early in this awards season. The fear was that Oppenheimer would be passed over in this category because Murphy’s performance was too internal and his reputation as a fearsomely good actor was maybe less well-known in America. I’m starting to think that’s not the case: Murphy won the Golden Globe, the BAFTA, and the Screen Actors Guild Award, a combination that very strongly indicates Oscars success. Giamatti’s charmingly grumpy turn in The Holdovers is a great reminder of everything he’s brought to the table for decades as an actor, and the same could be said for first-time nominee Wright. But Murphy is the galvanizing force in what seems to be voters’ favorite movie of the year, and his triumph may end up being a no-brainer. Domingo’s nomination was heartening because he’s one of the most thrilling working actors, but Rustin was otherwise ignored; before Maestro was released to the public, I might have predicted Cooper, but the film’s divisiveness with critics and audiences means he will once again leave Oscar night without a win.\n\nWho Will Win: Cillian Murphy\n\nWho Ought to Win: Cillian Murphy\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nNominees: Emily Blunt (Oppenheimer), Danielle Brooks (The Color Purple), America Ferrera (Barbie), Jodie Foster (Nyad), Da’Vine Joy Randolph (The Holdovers)\n\nThis race has been sealed up for months: Randolph has won nearly every pre-Oscars award. There’s a reason for that: She’s superb in The Holdovers, where she plays a mother grieving the loss of her son to the Vietnam War, and imbues her performance with balled-up pain and sadness while also earning the film’s biggest laughs. Foster, a two-time winner, is just happy to be here; her recognition is a sign that voters are happy to see her back on-screen. The other nominees are all being recognized for a standout moment in their respective films: Blunt’s steeliness in her deposition scene, Ferrara’s centerpiece monologue, and Brooks’s fantastic number “Hell No!”\n\nWho Will Win: Da’Vine Joy Randolph\n\nWho Ought to Win: Da’Vine Joy Randolph\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nNominees: Sterling K. Brown (American Fiction), Robert De Niro (Killers of the Flower Moon), Robert Downey Jr. (Oppenheimer), Ryan Gosling (Barbie), Mark Ruffalo (Poor Things)\n\nThis is perhaps the most stacked category of the evening, and that’s before we acknowledge some big snubs for Willem Dafoe and Charles Melton. Downey Jr. is the runaway favorite in what will be the final coronation in a career of ups and downs: First nominated for an Oscar for 1992’s Chaplin, he was at one point uninsurable because of his substance-abuse issues; he then became the biggest movie star in the world as the face of the Marvel brand. In Oppenheimer, he gives a meaty performance as the seething bureaucrat Lewis Strauss, the kind of dramatic turn voters love. It’s the only thing keeping Gosling from the win—Ken might be the pop-culture character of the year, but the Academy’s obvious disdain for Barbie’s silliness seems to be keeping it from being a top contender. And although I loved De Niro’s villainous performance in Flower Moon, he’s taken the Oscars stage before.\n\nWho Will Win: Robert Downey Jr.\n\nWho Ought to Win: Ryan Gosling\n\nBest Original Screenplay\n\nNominees: Justine Triet and Arthur Harari (Anatomy of a Fall), David Hemingson (The Holdovers), Bradley Cooper and Josh Singer (Maestro), Samy Burch and Alex Mechanik (May December), Celine Song (Past Lives)\n\nBoth screenplay races are very strong and feel like they could go in surprising directions—not atypical for the Academy, which often bucks trends in its writing categories. I’d give Anatomy of a Fall a small edge here, considering its general over-indexing with the Oscars: It made less than $5 million at the domestic box office yet scored Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actress nods. The Holdovers is a well-liked, witty work, and screenplay trophies often go to movies laden with funny dialogue; Past Lives, another Best Picture contender, could also get recognition here. May December’s spiky, challenging, ripped-from-the-headlines weirdness was too much for voters in every other category, but it’s nice to see it noted.\n\nWho Will Win: Anatomy of a Fall\n\nWho Ought to Win: May December\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay\n\nNominees: Cord Jefferson (American Fiction), Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach (Barbie), Christopher Nolan (Oppenheimer), Tony McNamara (Poor Things), Jonathan Glazer (The Zone of Interest)\n\nAdapted Screenplay could end up being another spot for Oppenheimer to grab a trophy, partly because Nolan crammed a doorstop-size biography into a legible script. Poor Things and American Fiction were both popular across the board, and this would be a logical place for them to win—the American Fiction writer-director Jefferson did collect a screenwriting BAFTA this year, which suggests real strength. But I’m going to bet that the backlash against Barbie’s snub in some major categories (Best Director and Best Actress) propels Barbie to a win here. One factor against it is that its screenplay is considered an “adaptation” even though it doesn’t work off of any specific material besides an enormous web of merchandising—but still, this is the place to give Gerwig applause for making the biggest hit of the year.\n\nWho Will Win: Barbie\n\nWho Ought to Win: Oppenheimer\n\nBest Director\n\nNominees: Jonathan Glazer (The Zone of Interest), Yorgos Lanthimos (Poor Things), Christopher Nolan (Oppenheimer), Martin Scorsese (Killers of the Flower Moon), Justine Triet (Anatomy of a Fall)\n\nAssuming he wins, Nolan’s arc with the Oscars will be remarkably similar to Steven Spielberg’s. Over the past two decades, Nolan has been a commercial powerhouse who’s often ignored by awards bodies because he trends toward making flash-bang genre films: The Dark Knight was blanked for Picture and Director, and Inception was also ignored for Director. But now that he’s made a historical epic that became a smash box-office hit, all is forgiven.

                        "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/giADvuU9jj3h7nOwwPwouEaXLjY=/0x124:2157x1247/1200x625/media/img/mt/2024/03/TheAtlantic_Twisha_Patni_Oscars_01/original.jpg",
                        "article_html": "<div><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">In some sense, this has been the most boring Oscar campaign in years. The minute <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/oppenheimer-movie-review-christopher-nolan/674749/\">Oppenheimer</a> blew past all expectations to become a critical and commercial smash, it seemed clear it would be an Academy Awards front-runner. Through the long and complicated slog of awards season, that prediction has largely come true: Christopher Nolan&#8217;s J. Robert Oppenheimer biopic has been a juggernaut, collecting Golden Globes, BAFTAs, and guild and critics&#8217; awards on its way to an expected Best Picture triumph.</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">But the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2024/01/oscars-2024-nomination-preview/677155/\">expected dominance of Oppenheimer</a> is merely an obvious conclusion to a night that may still surprise, particularly in the lead-acting categories and the two screenplay awards. As Hollywood gathers to celebrate a fraught but exciting year for cinema, with hits such as <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-review-greta-gerwig/674742/\">Barbie</a> and critical sensations such as <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/10/killers-of-the-flower-moon-review/675697/\">Killers of the Flower Moon</a> also up for a slew of prizes, which categories will provide the best chances for a shocking result? Here are my predictions.</p><h4 class=\"ArticleHeading_root__WKbPJ ArticleHeading_hed3__THdkc\"><strong>Best Actress</strong></h4><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\"><strong>Nominees: </strong>Annette Bening (Nyad), Lily Gladstone (Killers of the Flower Moon), Sandra H&#252;ller (Anatomy of a Fall), Carey Mulligan (Maestro), Emma Stone (Poor Things)</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">This is probably the most fluid Oscar race, with Gladstone seen as a slight favorite going into the final days. Her arresting work in Martin Scorsese&#8217;s epic has been the subject of a little category confusion&#8212;her character, Mollie, is central to the plot but goes missing for a good chunk, as she&#8217;s bedridden by a conspiratorial plot to kill her. Some industry experts thought Gladstone might try the supporting category, but she was wise to shoot for the lead, given that Mollie is the heart of the movie. Should Gladstone take home the prize, she would be the first Native American actor to win an acting Oscar&#8212;a huge milestone. Her main competition is Stone, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/12/poor-things-emma-stone-yorgos-lanthimos-interview/676289/\">whose extremely physical comedic masterclass in </a><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/12/poor-things-emma-stone-yorgos-lanthimos-interview/676289/\">Poor Things</a> would be a winner in many a year. But Stone already has an Oscar for 2017&#8217;s La La Land, and voters may be reluctant to award her another trophy so soon. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/11/nyad-movie-review/675852/\">Bening</a> and Mulligan are both beloved multiple-time nominees, but both of their movies had more committed detractors, while H&#252;ller&#8217;s complex work in <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/10/anatomy-of-a-fall-review/675636/\">Anatomy of a Fall</a> is sure to have passionate but not widespread support.</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\"><strong>Who Will Win: </strong>Lily Gladstone<br> <strong>Who Ought to Win: </strong>Lily Gladstone</p><h4 class=\"ArticleHeading_root__WKbPJ ArticleHeading_hed3__THdkc\"><strong>Best Actor</strong></h4><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\"><strong>Nominees: </strong>Bradley Cooper (Maestro), Colman Domingo (Rustin), Paul Giamatti (The Holdovers), Cillian Murphy (Oppenheimer), Jeffrey Wright (American Fiction)</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">Despite appearing in almost every frame of Oppenheimer, Murphy was a perpetual underdog early in this awards season. The fear was that Oppenheimer would be passed over in this category because Murphy&#8217;s performance was too internal and his reputation as a fearsomely good actor was maybe less well-known in America. I&#8217;m starting to think that&#8217;s not the case: Murphy won the Golden Globe, the BAFTA, and the Screen Actors Guild Award, a combination that very strongly indicates Oscars success. Giamatti&#8217;s charmingly grumpy turn in <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/10/the-holdovers-movie-review/675783/\">The Holdovers</a> is a great reminder of everything he&#8217;s brought to the table for decades <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2024/02/paul-giamatti-appreciation/677597/\">as an actor</a>, and the same could be said for first-time nominee Wright. But Murphy is the galvanizing force in what seems to be voters&#8217; favorite movie of the year, and his triumph may end up being a no-brainer. Domingo&#8217;s nomination was heartening because he&#8217;s one of the most thrilling working actors, but Rustin was otherwise ignored; before Maestro was released to the public, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/11/maestro-movie-review/676181/\">I might have predicted Cooper</a>, but the film&#8217;s divisiveness with critics and audiences means he will once again leave Oscar night without a win.</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\"><strong>Who Will Win: </strong>Cillian Murphy<br> <strong>Who Ought to Win: </strong>Cillian Murphy</p><h4 class=\"ArticleHeading_root__WKbPJ ArticleHeading_hed3__THdkc\"><strong>Best Supporting Actress</strong></h4><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\"><strong>Nominees: </strong>Emily Blunt (Oppenheimer), Danielle Brooks (The Color Purple), America Ferrera (Barbie), Jodie Foster (Nyad), Da&#8217;Vine Joy Randolph (The Holdovers)</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">This race has been sealed up for months: Randolph has won <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da%27Vine_Joy_Randolph#Awards_and_nominations\">nearly every</a> pre-Oscars award. There&#8217;s a reason for that: She&#8217;s superb in The Holdovers, where she plays a mother grieving the loss of her son to the Vietnam War, and imbues her performance with balled-up pain and sadness while also earning the film&#8217;s biggest laughs. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/04/jodie-foster-profile/677470/\">Foster</a>, a two-time winner, is just happy to be here; her recognition is a sign that voters are happy to see her back on-screen. The other nominees are all being recognized for a standout moment in their respective films: Blunt&#8217;s steeliness in her deposition scene, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-america-ferrera/674781/\">Ferrara&#8217;s centerpiece monologue</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/12/color-purple-adaptation-movie/676919/\">Brooks&#8217;s fantastic number &#8220;Hell No!&#8221;</a></p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\"><strong>Who Will Win: </strong>Da&#8217;Vine Joy Randolph<br> <strong>Who Ought to Win: </strong>Da&#8217;Vine Joy Randolph</p><h4 class=\"ArticleHeading_root__WKbPJ ArticleHeading_hed3__THdkc\"><strong>Best Supporting Actor</strong></h4><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\"><strong>Nominees: </strong>Sterling K. Brown (American Fiction), Robert De Niro (Killers of the Flower Moon), Robert Downey Jr. (Oppenheimer), Ryan Gosling (Barbie), Mark Ruffalo (Poor Things)</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">This is perhaps the most stacked category of the evening, and that&#8217;s before we acknowledge some big snubs for Willem Dafoe and Charles Melton. Downey Jr. is the runaway favorite in what will be the final coronation in a career of ups and downs: First nominated for an Oscar for 1992&#8217;s Chaplin, he was at one point uninsurable because of his substance-abuse issues; he then became the biggest movie star in the world as the face of the Marvel brand. In Oppenheimer, he gives a meaty performance as the seething bureaucrat Lewis Strauss, the kind of dramatic turn voters love. It&#8217;s the only thing keeping Gosling from the win&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-ken/674852/\">Ken might be the pop-culture character of the year</a>, but the Academy&#8217;s obvious disdain for Barbie&#8217;s silliness seems to be keeping it from being a top contender. And although I loved De Niro&#8217;s villainous performance in Flower Moon, he&#8217;s taken the Oscars stage before.</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\"><strong>Who Will Win: </strong>Robert Downey Jr.<br> <strong>Who Ought to Win: </strong>Ryan Gosling</p><h4 class=\"ArticleHeading_root__WKbPJ ArticleHeading_hed3__THdkc\"><strong>Best Original Screenplay</strong></h4><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\"><strong>Nominees: </strong>Justine Triet and Arthur Harari (Anatomy of a Fall), David Hemingson (The Holdovers), Bradley Cooper and Josh Singer (Maestro), Samy Burch and Alex Mechanik (May December), Celine Song (Past Lives)</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">Both screenplay races are very strong and feel like they could go in surprising directions&#8212;not atypical for the Academy, which often bucks trends in its writing categories. I&#8217;d give Anatomy of a Fall a small edge here, considering its general over-indexing with the Oscars: It made less than $5 million at the domestic box office yet scored Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actress nods. The Holdovers is a well-liked, witty work, and screenplay trophies often go to movies laden with funny dialogue; <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/06/past-lives-movie-review/674293/\">Past Lives</a>, another Best Picture contender, could also get recognition here. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/12/may-december-todd-haynes-interview/676258/\">May December&#8217;s spiky, challenging, ripped-from-the-headlines weirdness</a> was too much for voters in every other category, but it&#8217;s nice to see it noted.</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\"><strong>Who Will Win: </strong>Anatomy of a Fall<br> <strong>Who Ought to Win: </strong>May December</p><h4 class=\"ArticleHeading_root__WKbPJ ArticleHeading_hed3__THdkc\"><strong>Best Adapted Screenplay</strong></h4><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\"><strong>Nominees: </strong>Cord Jefferson (American Fiction), Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach (Barbie), Christopher Nolan (Oppenheimer), Tony McNamara (Poor Things), Jonathan Glazer (The Zone of Interest)</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">Adapted Screenplay could end up being another spot for Oppenheimer to grab a trophy, partly because Nolan crammed a doorstop-size biography into a legible script. Poor Things and <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2024/01/american-fiction-interview-cord-jefferson/677019/\">American Fiction</a> were both popular across the board, and this would be a logical place for them to win&#8212;the American Fiction writer-director Jefferson did collect a screenwriting BAFTA this year, which suggests real strength. But I&#8217;m going to bet that the backlash against Barbie&#8217;s snub in some major categories (Best Director and Best Actress) propels Barbie to a win here. One factor against it is that its screenplay is considered an &#8220;adaptation&#8221; even though it doesn&#8217;t work off of any specific material besides an enormous web of merchandising&#8212;but still, this is the place to give Gerwig applause for making the biggest hit of the year.</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\"><strong>Who Will Win: </strong>Barbie<br> <strong>Who Ought to Win: </strong>Oppenheimer</p><h4 class=\"ArticleHeading_root__WKbPJ ArticleHeading_hed3__THdkc\"><strong>Best Director</strong></h4><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\"><strong>Nominees: </strong>Jonathan Glazer (The Zone of Interest), Yorgos Lanthimos (Poor Things), Christopher Nolan (Oppenheimer), Martin Scorsese (Killers of the Flower Moon), Justine Triet (Anatomy of a Fall)</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">Assuming he wins, Nolan&#8217;s arc with the Oscars will be remarkably similar to Steven Spielberg&#8217;s. Over the past two decades, Nolan has been a commercial powerhouse who&#8217;s often ignored by awards bodies because he trends toward making flash-bang genre films: The Dark Knight was blanked for Picture and Director, and Inception was also ignored for Director. But now that he&#8217;s made a historical epic that became a smash box-office hit, all is forgiven. The Oscars are beyond ready to tip their cap to a champion of cinema who also happened to make a movie that&#8217;s &#8220;serious&#8221; in the way that voters appreciate.</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\"><strong>Who Will Win:</strong> Christopher Nolan<br> <strong>Who Ought to Win: </strong>Christopher Nolan</p><h4 class=\"ArticleHeading_root__WKbPJ ArticleHeading_hed3__THdkc\"><strong>Best Picture</strong></h4><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\"><strong>Nominees: </strong>American Fiction, Anatomy of a Fall, Barbie, The Holdovers, Killers of the Flower Moon, Maestro, Oppenheimer, Past Lives, Poor Things, The Zone of Interest</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">There&#8217;s been some mild noise about spoiler contenders here&#8212;maybe Barbie will ride the backlash to a win; maybe <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/12/zone-of-interest-movie-auschwitz-holocaust/676385/\">The Zone of Interest</a> will capitalize on buzzing discussion of a film that&#8217;s daringly topical.

                        "summaryai": "Despite initial predictions of a dominant Oppenheimer victory at the Oscars, this year's campaign has seen some surprising twists, particularly in lead-acting categories and screenplays. However, Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer remains the heavy favorite for Best Picture, expected to secure a substantial number of awards. Still, surprises may arise, with the most competitive categories being Best Actress (likely Lily Gladstone), Best Actor (possibly Cillian Murphy), and Best Original Screenplay (potentially Anatomy of a Fall). The dominance of Oppenheimer is seen as a sign of the Academy's willingness to recognize commercial success in \"serious\" historical dramas."

                "newstext": "Brittany Mahomes has a message for her fellow moms: \"Take care of your pelvic floor.\"\n\n\"Just your daily reminder: Once you have kids please take care of your pelvic floor,\" Mahomes wrote in an Instagram story this week. \"Seriously. From: A girl with a fractured back.\" Mahomes is a mother of two – Sterling, 3, and Patrick, 15 months – with Kansas City Chiefs quarterback husband Patrick Mahomes III. She didn't go into further detail about how her injury.\n\nSome reading her post may have wondered what a pelvic floor actually is.\n\nYou probably don't know unless you've had some kind of issue with yours, like Mahomes. The pelvic floor refers to the hammock of muscles and supporting connective tissue that supports your pelvic organs, i.e., anything below the belly button and between the the thighs. For women, this includes the urethra, bladder, vagina, uterus and surrounding intestines. Pelvic floor issues often come up postpartum – and can result in painful sexual experiences.\n\n\"(The pelvic floor muscles) are very overlooked in most people, because you can't really see them,\" Dr. Cheryl Igelsia, urogynecology specialist at MedStar Health, previously told USA TODAY. \"But they serve such an important function so that you're not pooping, peeing on yourself, and we can also engage in sexual relations and have orgasms.\"\n\nWhen women have issues with their pelvic floors, it could mean leaking urine (urinary incontinence), pelvic organ prolapse (organs pressing down or into the vagina) or fecal incontinence. They may also have pain with sex, an issue that is rarely discussed but that research suggests impacts 10-28% of women during their lifetime.\n\nWomen – and at times men – who encounter issues with their pelvic floors can get help from pelvic floor physical therapists. These therapists will often give patients exercises to improve their aliments.\n\n\"The pelvic floor physical therapists are really specialized in helping women make sure that they're performing these exercises appropriately,\" Dr. Victoria Scott, urologist and medical advisor at Flo, previously told USA TODAY.\n\nPelvic floor therapy, explained\n\nPelvic floor therapy helps men and women either tighten or loosen their pelvic floor muscles, depending on the issues at hand. Women may be instructed to practice Kegel exercises (squeezing and relaxing of the pelvic floor muscles), for example, to help tighten muscles. Signs women may need tightening if they can't make it to the bathroom on time or if pee comes out each time they laugh, cough or sneeze.\n\nAs for loosening: \"A lot of women actually have pelvic floors that are too tight,\" Scott says. \"So the pelvic floor physical therapist can be super helpful in identifying that, 'hey, stop doing the Kegels. We need to do stretching and relaxing techniques.'\"\n\nBoth types of pelvic floor issues can cause pain during sex.\n\nWhat to know before going to pelvic floor therapy\n\nOften to resolve pelvic floor issues, a pelvic floor physical therapist will work with the patient on both internal and external exercises. Look at legitimate databases when seeking care and be wary of any providers that make you feel uncomfortable. (Look no further than the Larry Nassar case to see mismanaged pelvic floor treatment).\n\nAlso be sure to check which therapists are covered by insurance.\n\nWhile you may need to work on these exercises the rest of your life – after all, you want your sex life to be as robust as possible, in addition to maintaining your overall health – don't expect to visit a physical therapist forever. \"Maybe patients can expect weekly for about six weeks, and then at that time, typically as with any other PT like for your ankle or your knee, they might say, 'OK, I think you've got it. Call me if you need me in the future,'\" Scott says.\n\nMen may need pelvic floor therapy, too\n\nWe all have pelvic floors. Though pregnancy can make the therapy more applicable to women, men may also need help training their pelvic floors, particularly when it comes to bladder issues.\n\n\"It can be helpful for some men who have tighter pelvic floor muscles that cause more of a pelvic floor muscle dysfunction,\" Scott says. \"So they're not relaxing their muscles properly, and this can cause pelvic pain, urinary urgency, frequency, difficulty emptying the bladder.\"\n\nWatch:These men tried a period pain simulator. Their wild reactions carry an important message.\n\nCan I try pelvic floor therapy at home?\n\nYes. You'll want to see a doctor first for a quick evaluation and to make sure nothing's wrong. Definitely go if you have blood in your urine or terrible pain.\n\nBut if you had a baby six months ago and still find yourself leaking urine, you can certainly try Kegel exercises on your own. Other exercises like squats and bridges can help engage pelvic floor muscles and core, and can also help treat and even prevent mild leakage in the future. Consider yoga, pilates and diaphragmatic breathing, too.\n\nA pelvic floor physical therapist will help you make sure you're engaging muscles properly.\n\nWhichever method you choose, retraining your pelvic floor could mean fewer medications, procedures or surgeries in the future, in addition to having more comfortable sex. Meaning, as Scott says, \"this is a really good tool for the rest of your life.\"\n\nLet's talk about (queer) sex:The importance of LGBTQ-inclusive sex education in schools",

The pelvic floor, which supports pelvic organs like the bladder and uterus, can weaken after childbirth, potentially leading to issues such as urinary incontinence, organ prolapse, and pain during sex. Pelvic floor physical therapists offer exercises to improve these conditions, both for tightening and loosening muscles. Experts emphasize the importance of seeking qualified therapists and checking insurance coverage. While pelvic floor therapy may require ongoing practice, it can significantly improve overall health and sexual well-being.",

From: A girl with a fractured back.\" Mahomes is a mother of two – Sterling, 3, and Patrick, 15 months – with Kansas City Chiefs quarterback husband Patrick Mahomes III. She didn't go into further detail about how her injury.\n\nSome reading her post may have wondered what a pelvic floor actually is.\n\nYou probably don't know unless you've had some kind of issue with yours, like Mahomes. The pelvic floor refers to the hammock of muscles and supporting connective tissue that supports your pelvic organs, i.e., anything below the belly button and between the the thighs. For women, this includes the urethra, bladder, vagina, uterus and surrounding intestines. Pelvic floor issues often come up postpartum – and can result in painful sexual experiences.\n\n\"(The pelvic floor muscles) are very overlooked in most people, because you can't really see them,\" Dr. Cheryl Igelsia, urogynecology specialist at MedStar Health, previously told USA TODAY. \"But they serve such an important function so that you're not pooping, peeing on yourself, and we can also engage in sexual relations and have orgasms.\"\n\nWhen women have issues with their pelvic floors, it could mean leaking urine (urinary incontinence), pelvic organ prolapse (organs pressing down or into the vagina) or fecal incontinence. They may also have pain with sex, an issue that is rarely discussed but that research suggests impacts 10-28% of women during their lifetime.\n\nWomen – and at times men – who encounter issues with their pelvic floors can get help from pelvic floor physical therapists. These therapists will often give patients exercises to improve their aliments.\n\n\"The pelvic floor physical therapists are really specialized in helping women make sure that they're performing these exercises appropriately,\" Dr. Victoria Scott, urologist and medical advisor at Flo, previously told USA TODAY.\n\nPelvic floor therapy, explained\n\nPelvic floor therapy helps men and women either tighten or loosen their pelvic floor muscles, depending on the issues at hand. Women may be instructed to practice Kegel exercises (squeezing and relaxing of the pelvic floor muscles), for example, to help tighten muscles. Signs women may need tightening if they can't make it to the bathroom on time or if pee comes out each time they laugh, cough or sneeze.\n\nAs for loosening: \"A lot of women actually have pelvic floors that are too tight,\" Scott says. \"So the pelvic floor physical therapist can be super helpful in identifying that, 'hey, stop doing the Kegels. We need to do stretching and relaxing techniques.'\"\n\nBoth types of pelvic floor issues can cause pain during sex.\n\nWhat to know before going to pelvic floor therapy\n\nOften to resolve pelvic floor issues, a pelvic floor physical therapist will work with the patient on both internal and external exercises. Look at legitimate databases when seeking care and be wary of any providers that make you feel uncomfortable. (Look no further than the Larry Nassar case to see mismanaged pelvic floor treatment).\n\nAlso be sure to check which therapists are covered by insurance.\n\nWhile you may need to work on these exercises the rest of your life – after all, you want your sex life to be as robust as possible, in addition to maintaining your overall health – don't expect to visit a physical therapist forever. \"Maybe patients can expect weekly for about six weeks, and then at that time, typically as with any other PT like for your ankle or your knee, they might say, 'OK, I think you've got it. Call me if you need me in the future,'\" Scott says.\n\nMen may need pelvic floor therapy, too\n\nWe all have pelvic floors. Though pregnancy can make the therapy more applicable to women, men may also need help training their pelvic floors, particularly when it comes to bladder issues.\n\n\"It can be helpful for some men who have tighter pelvic floor muscles that cause more of a pelvic floor muscle dysfunction,\" Scott says. \"So they're not relaxing their muscles properly, and this can cause pelvic pain, urinary urgency, frequency, difficulty emptying the bladder.\"\n\nWatch:These men tried a period pain simulator.

Men may also benefit from pelvic floor therapy to address bladder issues.

                "newstext": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe NFL salary cap went up a record 13.6% this year, from $224.8 million to $255.4 million per team. The jump could be a huge benefit to players hitting free agency in the coming week, as teams will have more cap space to spend. But the news was also received well in front offices, where teams had been budgeting for a cap in the range of $240-245 million and had some recalculating to do once the news dropped at the end of February.\n\n\"We were hoping it would get to $250 [million], but we didn't really expect it to,\" said Brandon Beane, the general manager of the cap-strapped Buffalo Bills, last week at the combine. \"We were conservatively planning for a number in the 40s. So to get the 255 [million], I was smiling.\"\n\nGood for the players, good for the teams. The NFL is financially healthy, and everyone's making money. But what do fans need to know about the unprecedented $30.6 million salary cap jump and what it means for this season -- and seasons to come? We've got you covered with big questions and takeaways, including which teams and players could be most affected.\n\nJump to the cap increase impact on:\n\nFranchise tags | Teams with cap issues\n\nFree agent spending | Cut designation\n\nWhy did the cap go up so much this year?\n\nThe NFL's salary cap is calculated based on a percentage of projected league revenues for the coming season. The collective bargaining agreement (CBA) breaks the revenues down into three buckets: league media revenue (basically, money made from television rights deals), NFL ventures/postseason revenue (money made from postseason games and NFL-operated entities such as the NFL Network) and local revenue (money made by teams in their local markets, such as selling local broadcast rights to preseason games). The total player cost for the year is the sum of 55% of league media revenue, 45% of NFL ventures/postseason revenue and 40% of local revenue.\n\nThe league can reduce the total number via stadium credits -- money used for stadium construction and renovation -- as long as the player cost number doesn't fall below 48% of the total revenue projections. And the player cost can be increased via a \"media kicker\" as a result of new TV rights deals negotiated since the 2020 signing of the CBA.\n\nBasically once that player cost is established, the number gets divided by 32 to get to the per-team salary cap number for the year. This season's player cost number was determined to be about $10.54 billion, and when you divide that by 32, you get $329.4 million per team. Subtract another $74 million per franchise for the cost assigned to player benefits (such as performance-based pay and benefits for retired players), and now you get the $255.4 million per team for player salaries.\n\nAccording to league and NFL Players Association sources, the 2024 number was significantly larger than the 2023 figure for at least three reasons:\n\nRevenues were impacted by the massive new TV rights deals signed by the league with its broadcast partners in 2021.\n\nAll of the player benefits deferred via the 2020 \"COVID-19 CBA\" have now been paid back. The league and the union paid those benefits back gradually over the previous few years, deducting the amount from the final cap calculation, and they no longer have to do so.\n\nSeveral teams outperformed their revenue projections for 2023, leading to improved revenue projections for 2024. Two teams cited as examples here were the Detroit Lions (who had two home playoff games after not having one since 1993) and the New York Jets (whose local revenues were significantly impacted by the offseason acquisition of Aaron Rodgers, even if Rodgers' season lasted four snaps).\n\nSo is this a one-time thing, or will the cap start going up $30 million every year now?\n\nThe sources to whom I've spoken don't expect a similar increase in 2025. In fact, in the negotiations between the league and the NFLPA to finalize this year's cap, an agreement was reached to \"float\" about $8-10 million of this year's increase into next year. Yes, this means that this year's cap could have been as high as $265 million if it were based solely on the raw revenue-production numbers.\n\nBut why defer some of the increase into 2025? It's easy to understand why the league would agree to such a thing, because the cap as a general concept benefits the teams and not the players. But the NFLPA was concerned that the 2024 increases that resulted from the bump in TV revenue wouldn't translate into next year, and the union felt it would be unfair to the 2025 free agent class if the cap went up by $30 million this year and only, say, $2 million next year.\n\nIt's possible that 2025 revenue projections will come in higher than expected and the cap will spike again. But at this point, the expectation is that the 2025 increase will be more in line with the $10-12 million annual increases we've become accustomed to seeing.\n\nplay 0:46 Schefter: Poyer one of many cap-related cuts coming for Bills Adam Schefter discusses why the Bills released veteran safety Jordan Poyer.\n\nWhat effect did this have on franchise tag usage this offseason?\n\nIt's hard to look at the list of players who got tagged and find someone who wouldn't have been tagged had the cap been lower. One reason is that the tag numbers are tied to the cap number, which means once the cap came in high, so the tags did, too. Carolina's Brian Burns and Jacksonville's Josh Allen, for example, will earn $24.007 million each if they end up playing on the tag. Had the cap come in at $242 million, that franchise tag salary for linebackers would have been around $22.5 million.\n\nOne thing the higher cap might do -- and we'll see whether this happens at all -- is increase teams' ability to tag and trade players. Once a team tags someone, it has to carry the full amount of the tag on its salary cap, even if the player hasn't signed it yet.\n\nSo take the Kansas City Chiefs, who will be carrying a $19.802 million cap charge for cornerback L'Jarius Sneed as soon as the league year starts on March 13. Some around the league believe the Chiefs plan to trade Sneed to a team willing to give him the contract extension he seeks, and if that's true, the higher cap number makes it easier for the Chiefs to carry Sneed into the new league year before ultimately trading him. They have to clear about $13 million less in cap space than they planned in order to fit Sneed under the number. The same could potentially be said for Burns, Cincinnati receiver Tee Higgins or any other player who might be a tag-and-trade candidate.\n\nHow does this help teams dealing with massive cap charges for their stars?\n\nLet's look at the Dallas Cowboys. Quarterback Dak Prescott currently carries a $59.455 million cap charge for 2024. He has one year left on his contract, plus two void years in 2025 and 2026. The Cowboys could lower Prescott's cap number with a contract extension, but in the past they have found it difficult to reach agreement with him on an extension. Plus, the QB has the leverage, since a $59.455 million cap number is brutally high. (The highest in the league in 2023 was Patrick Mahomes' $37 million.)\n\nBut again, every team in the league basically found roughly $13 million in cap space just lying on the ground a few weeks ago. So that's $13 million less work the Cowboys have to do to get under the cap. They still probably can't carry a $59.455 million charge for Prescott and operate the rest of their offseason around that. But they might not need to extend him to get where they need to go.\n\nThe Cowboys can convert up to $27.79 million of Prescott's $29 million in 2024 salary into a signing bonus. They can do the same with his March 17 roster bonus (assuming they do it before March 17). Just doing those two quick moves -- without adding any more void years to the deal -- would save them $21.86 million in cap space in 2024, and they wouldn't even need Prescott's permission to do it. Now the problem is that the Cowboys would have to carry a dead money charge of $58.32 million for Prescott in 2025 if they don't re-sign him. But they can buy themselves another year to solve that problem with the simple automatic conversion that doesn't require Prescott's approval.\n\nSome more team-specific examples:\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers have four star players -- wide receivers Keenan Allen and Mike Williams, and edge rushers Joey Bosa and Khalil Mack -- with cap numbers over $32 million for 2024. If the cap had come in at $242 million, they might have had to cut two or even three of those guys to get under it. At $255 million, they might have to release only one, maybe two of them.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers have a better chance of being able to keep their Super Bowl team together. San Francisco is still going to need to restructure a contract or two -- maybe offensive tackle Trent Williams or edge rusher Arik Armstead -- to get under the cap, but carrying receiver Brandon Aiyuk on his $14.124 million fifth-year option seems more palatable now than it did a couple of weeks ago. A lower cap might have forced the Niners to consider trading Aiyuk if they couldn't get him extended, but the higher number buys some time to figure it out.\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals might be able to keep their offensive core together longer than expected. Cincinnati has cap space but a lot of needs on defense, so it will need to spend some there. Carrying Higgins on a $21.816 million franchise tag and running back Joe Mixon on his $8.85 million cap number would have been trickier at the lower cap number. But if the Bengals now want to squeeze another season out of this Super Bowl-caliber group they've built around Joe Burrow, it's going to be a little bit easier.\n\nThe Cleveland Browns don't want to cut running back Nick Chubb, who is coming off a knee injury. They love the guy. But they also can't carry him on a $15.825 million cap number. They will have to either extend him or negotiate some sort of pay cut if he is going to be on the 2024 team. If it's the latter, the expanded cap means the Browns might not have to offer as deep a cut to a valued player as they might have otherwise.\n\nWho else does this higher cap number benefit?\n\nBig-name free agents: With more teams flush with cap space -- and the teams that were already flush even more so -- the bidding for the top free agents should go higher this month. If you're Minnesota Vikings edge rusher Danielle Hunter, for example, and you just saw Allen and Burns get tagged, you can present yourself as the best edge rusher on the free agent market. Scarcity at that position increases demand, and the teams have more to spend. The same could be said for New York Giants safety Xavier McKinney, who did not get franchised while Tampa Bay Buccaneers safety Antoine Winfield Jr. did (and New England Patriots safety Kyle Dugger got the transition tag).\n\nThe wide receivers looking for new deals: Last offseason, the top end of the receiver market stood still after exploding in 2022. Stars like Justin Jefferson and CeeDee Lamb sought but did not receive extensions. This year, the likes of Ja'Marr Chase and Amon-Ra St. Brown join them as extension-eligible. The top of the market at the position is likely to go over $30 million per year, and the looser cap might make it easier for teams to move on the extensions they didn't want to give out a year ago.\n\nHow will the cap number impact cut designations?\n\nThe post-June 1 cut is a device that allows teams to defray cap costs over multiple years. Generally, when releasing a player before his contract is up, a team must account for the remainder of his prorated signing bonus in a dead money cap charge. But teams are allowed to designate two players each year as post-June 1 cuts, which means they can split up the cap charge. Example: Releasing Russell Wilson will cost the Denver Broncos $85 million in dead money. This is because the extension he signed with Denver in 2022 included a $50 million signing bonus, a $20 million 2023 option bonus and a $22 million 2024 option bonus.\n\nplay 1:34 Schefter explains what's next for Russell Wilson Adam Schefter reports on the Denver Broncos releasing Russell Wilson after the 2024 league year begins next Wednesday.\n\nCBA rules allow teams to prorate the cap impact of signing and option bonuses for up to five years, so Wilson's signing bonus was assigned in $10 million increments to the Broncos' cap in 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026. This means he has $30 million in signing bonus proration still to account for, and all of that accelerates onto the team's 2024 cap once he's released. The 2023 option bonus is split up into $4 million increments on the Broncos' cap in 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026 and 2027. So that has $16 million left on it, all of which will accelerate onto the 2024 cap. The 2024 option bonus will also accelerate onto the 2024 cap, bringing the total bonus proration charges to $68 million. Add in his fully guaranteed $17 million 2024 salary, and the dead money charge gets to $85 million.\n\nHowever, if the Broncos want to designate Wilson as a post-June 1 cut, they'd have to carry only $35.4 million on this year's cap (the $17 million salary plus one year's worth of proration from the signing bonus and each of the two option bonuses), while the remaining $49.6 million would be a dead money charge on their 2025 cap. If the Broncos wanted to take the whole hit this season and keep it away from their 2025 cap, they could. This is obviously an extreme example, as there's no cap increase that's going to help a team carry $85 million in dead money charges for one player. But any other team in a similar situation at lower numbers might have an easier time taking the whole hit this year and keeping next year's cap clean due to the increase.",

But the news was also received well in front offices, where teams had been budgeting for a cap in the range of $240-245 million and had some recalculating to do once the news dropped at the end of February.</p><p>\"We were hoping it would get to $250 [million], but we didn't really expect it to,\" said Brandon Beane, the general manager of the cap-strapped <a href=\"/nfl/team/_/name/buf/buffalo-bills\">Buffalo Bills</a>, last week at the combine. \"We were conservatively planning for a number in the 40s.

But what do fans need to know about the unprecedented $30.6 million salary cap jump and what it means for this season -- and seasons to come? We've got you covered with big questions and takeaways, including which teams and players could be most affected.</p><p align=\"center\"><strong>Jump to the cap increase impact on:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"/nfl/story/_/id/39666536/nfl-salary-cap-increase-free-agency-takeaways-questions#tags\">Franchise tags</a> | <a href=\"/nfl/story/_/id/39666536/nfl-salary-cap-increase-free-agency-takeaways-questions#teams\">Teams with cap issues</a><br>\n<a href=\"/nfl/story/_/id/39666536/nfl-salary-cap-increase-free-agency-takeaways-questions#players\">Free agent spending</a> | <a href=\"/nfl/story/_/id/39666536/nfl-salary-cap-increase-free-agency-takeaways-questions#cuts\">Cut designation</a></p><img src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20170710_nfl_fpr/charts/_end_rule.png\" width=\"100%\"><h2>Why did the cap go up so much this year?</h2><p>The NFL's salary cap is calculated based on a percentage of projected league revenues for the coming season. The collective bargaining agreement (CBA) breaks the revenues down into three buckets: league media revenue (basically, money made from television rights deals), NFL ventures/postseason revenue (money made from postseason games and NFL-operated entities such as the NFL Network) and local revenue (money made by teams in their local markets, such as selling local broadcast rights to preseason games). The total player cost for the year is the sum of 55% of league media revenue, 45% of NFL ventures/postseason revenue and 40% of local revenue.</p><p>The league can reduce the total number via stadium credits -- money used for stadium construction and renovation -- as long as the player cost number doesn't fall below 48% of the total revenue projections. And the player cost can be increased via a \"media kicker\" as a result of new TV rights deals negotiated since the 2020 signing of the CBA.</p><p>Basically once that player cost is established, the number gets divided by 32 to get to the per-team salary cap number for the year. This season's player cost number was determined to be about $10.54 billion, and when you divide that by 32, you get $329.4 million per team. Subtract another $74 million per franchise for the cost assigned to player benefits (such as performance-based pay and benefits for retired players), and now you get the $255.4 million per team for player salaries.</p><p>According to league and NFL Players Association sources, the 2024 number was significantly larger than the 2023 figure for at least three reasons:</p><ul><li><p>Revenues were impacted by the massive new TV rights deals signed by the league with its broadcast partners in 2021.</p></li><li><p>All of the player benefits deferred via the <a href=\"/nfl/story/_/id/28906786/nfl-players-approve-new-cba-2030\">2020 \"COVID-19 CBA\"</a> have now been paid back. The league and the union paid those benefits back gradually over the previous few years, deducting the amount from the final cap calculation, and they no longer have to do so.</p></li><li><p>Several teams outperformed their revenue projections for 2023, leading to improved revenue projections for 2024. Two teams cited as examples here were the <a href=\"/nfl/team/_/name/det/detroit-lions\">Detroit Lions</a> (who had two home playoff games after not having one since 1993) and the <a href=\"/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets\">New York Jets</a> (whose local revenues were significantly impacted by the offseason acquisition of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8439/aaron-rodgers\">Aaron Rodgers</a>, even if Rodgers' season lasted <a href=\"/nfl/story/_/id/38385791/sources-jets-aaron-rodgers-torn-achilles-tendon\">four snaps</a>).</p></li></ul><h2>So is this a one-time thing, or will the cap start going up $30 million every year now?</h2><p>The sources to whom I've spoken don't expect a similar increase in 2025. In fact, in the negotiations between the league and the NFLPA to finalize this year's cap, an agreement was reached to \"float\" about $8-10 million of this year's increase into next year. Yes, this means that this year's cap could have been as high as $265 million if it were based solely on the raw revenue-production numbers.</p><p>But why defer some of the increase into 2025? It's easy to understand why the league would agree to such a thing, because the cap as a general concept benefits the teams and not the players. But the NFLPA was concerned that the 2024 increases that resulted from the bump in TV revenue wouldn't translate into next year, and the union felt it would be unfair to the 2025 free agent class if the cap went up by $30 million this year and only, say, $2 million next year.</p><p>It's possible that 2025 revenue projections will come in higher than expected and the cap will spike again. But at this point, the expectation is that the 2025 increase will be more in line with the $10-12 million annual increases we've become accustomed to seeing.</p><img class=\" lazyload lazyload\"><p class=\"video-play-button\">play</p><p class=\"media-duration\">0:46</p><p class=\"contentItem__title contentItem__title--media\">Schefter: Poyer one of many cap-related cuts coming for Bills</p><p class=\"contentItem__subhead\">Adam Schefter discusses why the Bills released veteran safety Jordan Poyer.</p><p></p><h2>What effect did this have on franchise tag usage this offseason?</h2><p>It's hard to look at the <a href=\"/nfl/story/_/id/39466104/2024-nfl-franchise-tag-tracker\">list of players who got tagged</a> and find someone who wouldn't have been tagged had the cap been lower. One reason is that the tag numbers are tied to the cap number, which means once the cap came in high, so the tags did, too. Carolina's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035631/brian-burns\">Brian Burns</a> and Jacksonville's <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915239/josh-allen\">Josh Allen</a>, for example, will earn $24.007 million each if they end up playing on the tag. Had the cap come in at $242 million, that franchise tag salary for linebackers would have been around $22.5 million.</p><p>One thing the higher cap might do -- and we'll see whether this happens at all -- is increase teams' ability to tag and trade players. Once a team tags someone, it has to carry the full amount of the tag on its salary cap, even if the player hasn't signed it yet.</p><p>So take the <a href=\"/nfl/team/_/name/kc/kansas-city-chiefs\">Kansas City Chiefs</a>, who will be carrying a $19.802 million cap charge for cornerback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040432/ljarius-sneed\">L'Jarius Sneed</a> as soon as the league year starts on March 13. Some around the league believe the Chiefs plan to trade Sneed to a team willing to give him the contract extension he seeks, and if that's true, the higher cap number makes it easier for the Chiefs to carry Sneed into the new league year before ultimately trading him. They have to clear about $13 million less in cap space than they planned in order to fit Sneed under the number. The same could potentially be said for Burns, Cincinnati receiver <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4239993/tee-higgins\">Tee Higgins</a> or any other player who might be a tag-and-trade candidate.</p><p><a name=\"teams\"></a></p><h2>How does this help teams dealing with massive cap charges for their stars?</h2><p>Let's look at the <a href=\"/nfl/team/_/name/dal/dallas-cowboys\">Dallas Cowboys</a>. Quarterback <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2577417/dak-prescott\">Dak Prescott</a> currently carries a $59.455 million cap charge for 2024. He has one year left on his contract, plus two void years in 2025 and 2026. The Cowboys could lower Prescott's cap number with a contract extension, but in the past they have found it difficult to reach agreement with him on an extension. Plus, the QB has the leverage, since a $59.455 million cap number is brutally high. (The highest in the league in 2023 was <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a>' $37 million.)</p><p>But again, every team in the league basically found roughly $13 million in cap space just lying on the ground a few weeks ago. So that's $13 million less work the Cowboys have to do to get under the cap. They still probably can't carry a $59.455 million charge for Prescott and operate the rest of their offseason around that. But they might not need to extend him to get where they need to go.</p><p>The Cowboys can convert up to $27.79 million of Prescott's $29 million in 2024 salary into a signing bonus. They can do the same with his March 17 roster bonus (assuming they do it before March 17). Just doing those two quick moves -- without adding any more void years to the deal -- would save them $21.86 million in cap space in 2024, and they wouldn't even need Prescott's permission to do it. Now the problem is that the Cowboys would have to carry a <a href=\"/nfl/story/_/id/39665413/nfl-dead-money-charges-largest-hits-ever-player-team\">dead money</a> charge of $58.32 million for Prescott in 2025 if they don't re-sign him. But they can buy themselves another year to solve that problem with the simple automatic conversion that doesn't require Prescott's approval.</p><p>Some more team-specific examples:</p><ul><li><p>The <a href=\"/nfl/team/_/name/lac/los-angeles-chargers\">Los Angeles Chargers</a> have four star players -- wide receivers <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15818/keenan-allen\">Keenan Allen</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045138/mike-williams\">Mike Williams</a>, and edge rushers <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051389/joey-bosa\">Joey Bosa</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16710/khalil-mack\">Khalil Mack</a> -- with cap numbers over $32 million for 2024.

                        "newstext": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe NFL salary cap went up a record 13.6% this year, from $224.8 million to $255.4 million per team. The jump could be a huge benefit to players hitting free agency in the coming week, as teams will have more cap space to spend. But the news was also received well in front offices, where teams had been budgeting for a cap in the range of $240-245 million and had some recalculating to do once the news dropped at the end of February.\n\n\"We were hoping it would get to $250 [million], but we didn't really expect it to,\" said Brandon Beane, the general manager of the cap-strapped Buffalo Bills, last week at the combine. \"We were conservatively planning for a number in the 40s. So to get the 255 [million], I was smiling.\"\n\nGood for the players, good for the teams. The NFL is financially healthy, and everyone's making money. But what do fans need to know about the unprecedented $30.6 million salary cap jump and what it means for this season -- and seasons to come? We've got you covered with big questions and takeaways, including which teams and players could be most affected.\n\nJump to the cap increase impact on:\n\nFranchise tags | Teams with cap issues\n\nFree agent spending | Cut designation\n\nWhy did the cap go up so much this year?\n\nThe NFL's salary cap is calculated based on a percentage of projected league revenues for the coming season. The collective bargaining agreement (CBA) breaks the revenues down into three buckets: league media revenue (basically, money made from television rights deals), NFL ventures/postseason revenue (money made from postseason games and NFL-operated entities such as the NFL Network) and local revenue (money made by teams in their local markets, such as selling local broadcast rights to preseason games). The total player cost for the year is the sum of 55% of league media revenue, 45% of NFL ventures/postseason revenue and 40% of local revenue.\n\nThe league can reduce the total number via stadium credits -- money used for stadium construction and renovation -- as long as the player cost number doesn't fall below 48% of the total revenue projections. And the player cost can be increased via a \"media kicker\" as a result of new TV rights deals negotiated since the 2020 signing of the CBA.\n\nBasically once that player cost is established, the number gets divided by 32 to get to the per-team salary cap number for the year. This season's player cost number was determined to be about $10.54 billion, and when you divide that by 32, you get $329.4 million per team. Subtract another $74 million per franchise for the cost assigned to player benefits (such as performance-based pay and benefits for retired players), and now you get the $255.4 million per team for player salaries.\n\nAccording to league and NFL Players Association sources, the 2024 number was significantly larger than the 2023 figure for at least three reasons:\n\nRevenues were impacted by the massive new TV rights deals signed by the league with its broadcast partners in 2021.\n\nAll of the player benefits deferred via the 2020 \"COVID-19 CBA\" have now been paid back. The league and the union paid those benefits back gradually over the previous few years, deducting the amount from the final cap calculation, and they no longer have to do so.\n\nSeveral teams outperformed their revenue projections for 2023, leading to improved revenue projections for 2024. Two teams cited as examples here were the Detroit Lions (who had two home playoff games after not having one since 1993) and the New York Jets (whose local revenues were significantly impacted by the offseason acquisition of Aaron Rodgers, even if Rodgers' season lasted four snaps).\n\nSo is this a one-time thing, or will the cap start going up $30 million every year now?\n\nThe sources to whom I've spoken don't expect a similar increase in 2025. In fact, in the negotiations between the league and the NFLPA to finalize this year's cap, an agreement was reached to \"float\" about $8-10 million of this year's increase into next year. Yes, this means that this year's cap could have been as high as $265 million if it were based solely on the raw revenue-production numbers.\n\nBut why defer some of the increase into 2025? It's easy to understand why the league would agree to such a thing, because the cap as a general concept benefits the teams and not the players. But the NFLPA was concerned that the 2024 increases that resulted from the bump in TV revenue wouldn't translate into next year, and the union felt it would be unfair to the 2025 free agent class if the cap went up by $30 million this year and only, say, $2 million next year.\n\nIt's possible that 2025 revenue projections will come in higher than expected and the cap will spike again. But at this point, the expectation is that the 2025 increase will be more in line with the $10-12 million annual increases we've become accustomed to seeing.\n\nplay 0:46 Schefter: Poyer one of many cap-related cuts coming for Bills Adam Schefter discusses why the Bills released veteran safety Jordan Poyer.\n\nWhat effect did this have on franchise tag usage this offseason?\n\nIt's hard to look at the list of players who got tagged and find someone who wouldn't have been tagged had the cap been lower. One reason is that the tag numbers are tied to the cap number, which means once the cap came in high, so the tags did, too. Carolina's Brian Burns and Jacksonville's Josh Allen, for example, will earn $24.007 million each if they end up playing on the tag. Had the cap come in at $242 million, that franchise tag salary for linebackers would have been around $22.5 million.\n\nOne thing the higher cap might do -- and we'll see whether this happens at all -- is increase teams' ability to tag and trade players. Once a team tags someone, it has to carry the full amount of the tag on its salary cap, even if the player hasn't signed it yet.\n\nSo take the Kansas City Chiefs, who will be carrying a $19.802 million cap charge for cornerback L'Jarius Sneed as soon as the league year starts on March 13. Some around the league believe the Chiefs plan to trade Sneed to a team willing to give him the contract extension he seeks, and if that's true, the higher cap number makes it easier for the Chiefs to carry Sneed into the new league year before ultimately trading him. They have to clear about $13 million less in cap space than they planned in order to fit Sneed under the number. The same could potentially be said for Burns, Cincinnati receiver Tee Higgins or any other player who might be a tag-and-trade candidate.\n\nHow does this help teams dealing with massive cap charges for their stars?\n\nLet's look at the Dallas Cowboys. Quarterback Dak Prescott currently carries a $59.455 million cap charge for 2024. He has one year left on his contract, plus two void years in 2025 and 2026. The Cowboys could lower Prescott's cap number with a contract extension, but in the past they have found it difficult to reach agreement with him on an extension. Plus, the QB has the leverage, since a $59.455 million cap number is brutally high. (The highest in the league in 2023 was Patrick Mahomes' $37 million.)\n\nBut again, every team in the league basically found roughly $13 million in cap space just lying on the ground a few weeks ago. So that's $13 million less work the Cowboys have to do to get under the cap. They still probably can't carry a $59.455 million charge for Prescott and operate the rest of their offseason around that. But they might not need to extend him to get where they need to go.\n\nThe Cowboys can convert up to $27.79 million of Prescott's $29 million in 2024 salary into a signing bonus. They can do the same with his March 17 roster bonus (assuming they do it before March 17). Just doing those two quick moves -- without adding any more void years to the deal -- would save them $21.86 million in cap space in 2024, and they wouldn't even need Prescott's permission to do it. Now the problem is that the Cowboys would have to carry a dead money charge of $58.32 million for Prescott in 2025 if they don't re-sign him. But they can buy themselves another year to solve that problem with the simple automatic conversion that doesn't require Prescott's approval.\n\nSome more team-specific examples:\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers have four star players -- wide receivers Keenan Allen and Mike Williams, and edge rushers Joey Bosa and Khalil Mack -- with cap numbers over $32 million for 2024. If the cap had come in at $242 million, they might have had to cut two or even three of those guys to get under it. At $255 million, they might have to release only one, maybe two of them.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers have a better chance of being able to keep their Super Bowl team together. San Francisco is still going to need to restructure a contract or two -- maybe offensive tackle Trent Williams or edge rusher Arik Armstead -- to get under the cap, but carrying receiver Brandon Aiyuk on his $14.124 million fifth-year option seems more palatable now than it did a couple of weeks ago. A lower cap might have forced the Niners to consider trading Aiyuk if they couldn't get him extended, but the higher number buys some time to figure it out.\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals might be able to keep their offensive core together longer than expected. Cincinnati has cap space but a lot of needs on defense, so it will need to spend some there. Carrying Higgins on a $21.816 million franchise tag and running back Joe Mixon on his $8.85 million cap number would have been trickier at the lower cap number. But if the Bengals now want to squeeze another season out of this Super Bowl-caliber group they've built around Joe Burrow, it's going to be a little bit easier.\n\nThe Cleveland Browns don't want to cut running back Nick Chubb, who is coming off a knee injury. They love the guy. But they also can't carry him on a $15.825 million cap number. They will have to either extend him or negotiate some sort of pay cut if he is going to be on the 2024 team. If it's the latter, the expanded cap means the Browns might not have to offer as deep a cut to a valued player as they might have otherwise.\n\nWho else does this higher cap number benefit?\n\nBig-name free agents: With more teams flush with cap space -- and the teams that were already flush even more so -- the bidding for the top free agents should go higher this month. If you're Minnesota Vikings edge rusher Danielle Hunter, for example, and you just saw Allen and Burns get tagged, you can present yourself as the best edge rusher on the free agent market. Scarcity at that position increases demand, and the teams have more to spend. The same could be said for New York Giants safety Xavier McKinney, who did not get franchised while Tampa Bay Buccaneers safety Antoine Winfield Jr. did (and New England Patriots safety Kyle Dugger got the transition tag).\n\nThe wide receivers looking for new deals: Last offseason, the top end of the receiver market stood still after exploding in 2022. Stars like Justin Jefferson and CeeDee Lamb sought but did not receive extensions. This year, the likes of Ja'Marr Chase and Amon-Ra St. Brown join them as extension-eligible. The top of the market at the position is likely to go over $30 million per year, and the looser cap might make it easier for teams to move on the extensions they didn't want to give out a year ago.\n\nHow will the cap number impact cut designations?\n\nThe post-June 1 cut is a device that allows teams to defray cap costs over multiple years. Generally, when releasing a player before his contract is up, a team must account for the remainder of his prorated signing bonus in a dead money cap charge. But teams are allowed to designate two players each year as post-June 1 cuts, which means they can split up the cap charge. Example: Releasing Russell Wilson will cost the Denver Broncos $85 million in dead money. This is because the extension he signed with Denver in 2022 included a $50 million signing bonus, a $20 million 2023 option bonus and a $22 million 2024 option bonus.\n\nplay 1:34 Schefter explains what's next for Russell Wilson Adam Schefter reports on the Denver Broncos releasing Russell Wilson after the 2024 league year begins next Wednesday.\n\nCBA rules allow teams to prorate the cap impact of signing and option bonuses for up to five years, so Wilson's signing bonus was assigned in $10 million increments to the Broncos' cap in 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026. This means he has $30 million in signing bonus proration still to account for, and all of that accelerates onto the team's 2024 cap once he's released. The 2023 option bonus is split up into $4 million increments on the Broncos' cap in 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026 and 2027. So that has $16 million left on it, all of which will accelerate onto the 2024 cap. The 2024 option bonus will also accelerate onto the 2024 cap, bringing the total bonus proration charges to $68 million. Add in his fully guaranteed $17 million 2024 salary, and the dead money charge gets to $85 million.\n\nHowever, if the Broncos want to designate Wilson as a post-June 1 cut, they'd have to carry only $35.4 million on this year's cap (the $17 million salary plus one year's worth of proration from the signing bonus and each of the two option bonuses), while the remaining $49.6 million would be a dead money charge on their 2025 cap. If the Broncos wanted to take the whole hit this season and keep it away from their 2025 cap, they could. This is obviously an extreme example, as there's no cap increase that's going to help a team carry $85 million in dead money charges for one player. But any other team in a similar situation at lower numbers might have an easier time taking the whole hit this year and keeping next year's cap clean due to the increase.",

Stars like <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4262921/justin-jefferson\">Justin Jefferson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241389/ceedee-lamb\">CeeDee Lamb</a> sought but did not receive extensions. This year, the likes of <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4362628/jamarr-chase\">Ja'Marr Chase</a> and <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4374302/amon-ra-st-brown\">Amon-Ra St. Brown</a> join them as extension-eligible. The top of the market at the position is likely to go over $30 million per year, and the looser cap might make it easier for teams to move on the extensions they didn't want to give out a year ago.</p><p><a name=\"cuts\"></a></p><h2>How will the cap number impact cut designations?</h2><p>The post-June 1 cut is a device that allows teams to defray cap costs over multiple years. Generally, when releasing a player before his contract is up, a team must account for the remainder of his prorated signing bonus in a <a href=\"/nfl/story/_/id/39665413/what-dead-money-largest-nfl-salary-cap-hits-ever-player-team\">dead money cap charge</a>. But teams are allowed to designate two players each year as post-June 1 cuts, which means they can split up the cap charge. Example: <a href=\"/nfl/story/_/id/39654399/broncos-cut-russell-wilson-take-85m-dead-money-hit\">Releasing</a> <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14881/russell-wilson\">Russell Wilson</a> will cost the <a href=\"/nfl/team/_/name/den/denver-broncos\">Denver Broncos</a> $85 million in dead money. This is because the extension he signed with Denver in 2022 included a $50 million signing bonus, a $20 million 2023 option bonus and a $22 million 2024 option bonus.</p><img class=\" lazyload lazyload\"><p class=\"video-play-button\">play</p><p class=\"media-duration\">1:34</p><p class=\"contentItem__title contentItem__title--media\">Schefter explains what's next for Russell Wilson</p><p class=\"contentItem__subhead\">Adam Schefter reports on the Denver Broncos releasing Russell Wilson after the 2024 league year begins next Wednesday.</p><p class=\"ad-slot ad-slot-incontent2 ad-wrapper\"></p><p>CBA rules allow teams to prorate the cap impact of signing and option bonuses for up to five years, so Wilson's signing bonus was assigned in $10 million increments to the Broncos' cap in 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026. This means he has $30 million in signing bonus proration still to account for, and all of that accelerates onto the team's 2024 cap once he's released. The 2023 option bonus is split up into $4 million increments on the Broncos' cap in 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026 and 2027. So that has $16 million left on it, all of which will accelerate onto the 2024 cap. The 2024 option bonus will also accelerate onto the 2024 cap, bringing the total bonus proration charges to $68 million. Add in his fully guaranteed $17 million 2024 salary, and the dead money charge gets to $85 million.</p><p>However, if the Broncos want to designate Wilson as a post-June 1 cut, they'd have to carry only $35.4 million on this year's cap (the $17 million salary plus one year's worth of proration from the signing bonus and each of the two option bonuses), while the remaining $49.6 million would be a dead money charge on their 2025 cap. If the Broncos wanted to take the whole hit this season and keep it away from their 2025 cap, they could. This is obviously an extreme example, as there's no cap increase that's going to help a team carry $85 million in dead money charges for one player. But any other team in a similar situation at lower numbers might have an easier time taking the whole hit this year and keeping next year's cap clean due to the increase.</p>\n</div>",

The jump is attributed to increased league revenues, the end of COVID-19-related player benefit deferrals, and outperformance by some teams. While teams with cap issues have more room to operate, the higher cap also benefits free agents and wide receivers seeking contract extensions. Additionally, the expanded cap could impact post-June 1 cut designations, allowing teams to defer cap charges for released players over multiple years."

They have a new head coach, restructured their front office, and are expected to overhaul their roster from the top down.\n\nFree agency will be a key part of this process. And while adding external players to the mix will undoubtably happen, there are also quite a few in-house free agents to be taken care of. In total, 21 are headed toward the open market this spring and in need of a new contract.\n\nAmong them is linebacker Mack Wilson, the 21st and final player in our free agency profile series.\n\nHard facts\n\nName: Mack Wilson Sr.\n\nPosition: Off-the-ball linebacker/Defensive edge\n\nOpening day age: 26 (2/14/1998)\n\nSize: 6’1”, 246 lbs\n\nJersey number: 3\n\nFree agency status: Unrestricted free agent\n\nExperience\n\nWilson spent his college career at the University of Alabama. Having appeared in 33 total games over his first three seasons with the Crimson Tide and registering seven takeaways along the way, the junior defender decided to take his talents to the pro level in 2019 — against the advice of head coach Nick Saban.\n\nNonetheless, Wilson did hear his name called in the draft: the Cleveland Browns brought him in with the 155th overall selection in the fifth round.\n\nWilson was able to make an immediate impact on the Browns defense as a rookie. His future looked bright after he played 88 percent of defensive snaps that year, but he was unable to build on his early success. In fact, his defensive playing time decreased each year between 2019 and 2021, and he was used more as a role and special teams player by the end of his tenure.\n\nAfter playing 45 games in three years for the Browns, they decided to trade Wilson to the Patriots in the spring of 2022. Since then, he appeared in 34 games and registered five sacks as well as three forced fumbles.\n\n2023 review\n\nStats: 17 games (1 start) | 305 defensive snaps (26.8%), 312 special teams snaps (68.1%) | 33 tackles, 3 missed tackles (8.3%), 2 forced fumbles | 14 quarterback pressures (3.5 sacks, 1 hit, 9 hurries) | 8 targets, 7 catches surrendered (87.5%), 45 yards | 4 special teams tackles\n\nSeason recap: After effectively getting benched down the stretch in 2022, and being used exclusively on special teams over the final five games of the season, Wilson returning to the Patriots as a first-time free agent was far from a guarantee. However, the team did decide to re-sign him via a one-year, $1.6 million contract — a deal that did not guarantee Wilson a spot on the roster, but would allow him to compete for one.\n\nHe did just that, and in turn was able to make the Patriots’ 53-man roster as a rotational linebacker option capable of playing both off the ball and on the line of scrimmage. This versatile usage was nothing new for Wilson, but the team decided to keep stressing it even more in 2023.\n\nThe results speak for themselves. After Wilson played 15 percent of his defensive snaps on the line of scrimmage in 2022, that number jumped to 43 percent in 2023. With that increase came more snaps overall — 305 to be exact, enough to earn a $200,000 play time incentive — resulting in a player who was having a bigger impact on games than he had the previous season.\n\nTo a degree Wilson benefitted from the circumstances. When the Patriots lost Pro Bowl edge Matthew Judon to a season-ending biceps injury in Week 4, it put pressure on the club’s edge depth to a point where versatile off-ball linebackers such as Jahlani Tavai and Wilson moved up at an increased rate.\n\nRegardless of the why, Wilson made the most of his opportunities and produced his best statistical season since a promising rookie campaign with the Browns in 2019. In total, he finished the year with 33 tackles and 14 quarterback pressures including 3.5 sacks.\n\nIn addition to his work as a positionally flexible package defender, Wilson also was prominently featured in the kicking game. A regular on four units — kickoff coverage and return, punt coverage and return — his 68.1 play time share ranked sixth on the team. His four tackles also were tied for sixth-most for New England’s special teams coverage units.\n\nWilson did not suddenly turn into a major difference maker for the Patriots in 2023, that much is clear. However, he was a valuable role player who started building some momentum over the second half of the season in particular.\n\nFree agency preview\n\nWhat is his contract history? Arriving in the NFL as a fifth-round draft pick, Wilson signed a four-year, $2.83 million rookie pact when he joined the Browns. That deal sans its prorated signing bonus transferred to New England in 2022, when he was traded to the Patriots. After he entered free agency the following spring, he re-signed with the club on the aforementioned one-year, $1.6 million contract. In total, Over the Cap has calculated his career earnings at roughly $6.67 million.\n\nWhich teams might be in the running? The list of potential suitors should Wilson be allowed to enter the open market might depend on how teams view him: is he more of an edge, or more of a traditional off-ball linebacker. Clubs might have different answers depending on their current personnel and defensive scheme, but it appears the Chicago Bears, Arizona Cardinals, Carolina Panthers, Washington Commanders, Seattle Seahawks or Denver Broncos might all be keeping an eye on him.\n\nWhy should he be expected back? Wilson may not have been a huge impact player for the Patriots over the last two seasons, but he has provided a steady presence at multiple spots on defense and special teams. There is value in that, especially for a player who was on a clear upward trajectory in 2023, will be relatively affordable, is still young, and also offers experience in the system. All those points work in favor of a return.\n\nWhy should he be expected to leave? Wilson has yet to emerge past rotational status two seasons into his Patriots tenure, which in turn might impact how the team values him. Somebody else coming in with a more attractive offer both financially and in terms of role might be enough to convince the 26-year-old to leave New England.\n\nWhat is his projected free agency outcome? With Josh Uche and Anfernee Jennings also headed for free agency, the Patriots face considerable questions on their edge. And while Wilson is not the same type of player — or at least was not used in the same fashion — keeping him around would make sense regardless of what happens with the two youngsters; he has shown he can play solid football on a team whose roster is not overflowing with edge depth and special teams talent. A two-year deal at a slightly increased annual value totaling $4.8 million seems like a fair one for both sides.\n\nWhat do you think about Mack Wilson heading into free agency? Will he return to the Patriots as a free agent? Or will another team pick him up? Please head down to the comment section to discuss.",

Having appeared in 33 total games over his first three seasons with the Crimson Tide and registering seven takeaways along the way, the junior defender decided to take his talents to the pro level in 2019 &#8212; against the advice of head coach Nick Saban.</p>\n<p id=\"ca9kW5\">Nonetheless, Wilson did hear his name called in the draft: the <a href=\"https://www.dawgsbynature.com/\">Cleveland Browns</a> brought him in with the 155th overall selection in the fifth round.</p>\n<p id=\"t301sw\">Wilson was able to make an immediate impact on the Browns defense as a rookie. His future looked bright after he played 88 percent of defensive snaps that year, but he was unable to build on his early success. In fact, his defensive playing time decreased each year between 2019 and 2021, and he was used more as a role and special teams player by the end of his tenure.</p>\n<p id=\"i9e0rX\">After playing 45 games in three years for the Browns, they decided to trade Wilson to the Patriots in the spring of 2022. Since then, he appeared in 34 games and registered five sacks as well as three forced fumbles.</p>\n<h2 id=\"TO4lEy\">2023 review</h2>\n<p id=\"grJvEl\"><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?xcust=___sb__p_23846728__t_w__d_D&amp;id=66960X1641910&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.pff.com/subscribe&amp;referrer=sbnation.com&amp;sref=https://www.patspulpit.com/2024/2/26/24082687/patriots-2024-free-agency-profile-anfernee-jennings-edge-linebacker\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Stats</strong></a><strong>:</strong> 17 games (1 start) | 305 defensive snaps (26.8%), 312 special teams snaps (68.1%) | 33 tackles, 3 missed tackles (8.3%), 2 forced fumbles | 14 quarterback pressures (3.5 sacks, 1 hit, 9 hurries) | 8 targets, 7 catches surrendered (87.5%), 45 yards | 4 special teams tackles</p>\n<p id=\"skPcw1\"><strong>Season recap:</strong> After effectively getting benched down the stretch in 2022, and being used exclusively on special teams over the final five games of the season, Wilson returning to the Patriots as a first-time free agent was far from a guarantee. However, the team did decide to re-sign him via a one-year, $1.6 million contract &#8212; a deal that did not guarantee Wilson a spot on the roster, but would allow him to compete for one.</p>\n<p id=\"mwSoMq\">He did just that, and in turn was able to make the Patriots&#8217; 53-man roster as a rotational linebacker option capable of playing both off the ball and on the line of scrimmage. This versatile usage was nothing new for Wilson, but the team decided to keep stressing it even more in 2023.</p>\n<p id=\"rLQfj8\">The results speak for themselves. After Wilson played 15 percent of his defensive snaps on the line of scrimmage in 2022, that number jumped to 43 percent in 2023. With that increase came more snaps overall &#8212; 305 to be exact, enough to earn a $200,000 play time incentive &#8212; resulting in a player who was having a bigger impact on games than he had the previous season.</p>\n<p id=\"P1IUe1\">To a degree Wilson benefitted from the circumstances. When the Patriots lost Pro Bowl edge Matthew Judon to a season-ending biceps injury in Week 4, it put pressure on the club&#8217;s edge depth to a point where versatile off-ball linebackers such as Jahlani Tavai and Wilson moved up at an increased rate.</p>\n<p id=\"yX96c7\">Regardless of the why, Wilson made the most of his opportunities and produced his best statistical season since a promising rookie campaign with the Browns in 2019. In total, he finished the year with 33 tackles and 14 quarterback pressures including 3.5 sacks.</p>\n<p id=\"T9RXhO\">In addition to his work as a positionally flexible package defender, Wilson also was prominently featured in the kicking game. A regular on four units &#8212; kickoff coverage and return, punt coverage and return &#8212; his 68.1 play time share ranked sixth on the team. His four tackles also were tied for sixth-most for New England&#8217;s special teams coverage units.</p>\n<p id=\"oubF5V\">Wilson did not suddenly turn into a major difference maker for the Patriots in 2023, that much is clear. However, he was a valuable role player who started building some momentum over the second half of the season in particular.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fOHVNE\">Free agency preview</h2>\n<p id=\"m0oV8W\"><strong>What is his contract history?</strong> Arriving in the NFL as a fifth-round draft pick, Wilson signed a four-year, $2.83 million rookie pact when he joined the Browns. That deal sans its prorated signing bonus transferred to New England in 2022, when he was traded to the Patriots. After he entered free agency the following spring, he re-signed with the club on the aforementioned one-year, $1.6 million contract. In total, <a href=\"https://overthecap.com/player/mack-wilson/7946\">Over the Cap</a> has calculated his career earnings at roughly $6.67 million.</p>\n<p id=\"Eu84Nn\"><strong>Which teams might be in the running?</strong> The list of potential suitors should Wilson be allowed to enter the open market might depend on how teams view him: is he more of an edge, or more of a traditional off-ball linebacker. Clubs might have different answers depending on their current personnel and defensive scheme, but it appears the <a href=\"https://www.windycitygridiron.com/\">Chicago Bears</a>, <a href=\"https://www.revengeofthebirds.com/\">Arizona Cardinals</a>, <a href=\"https://www.catscratchreader.com/\">Carolina Panthers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hogshaven.com/\">Washington Commanders</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fieldgulls.com/\">Seattle Seahawks</a> or <a href=\"https://www.milehighreport.com/\">Denver Broncos</a> might all be keeping an eye on him.</p>\n<p id=\"2KJeh4\"><strong>Why should he be expected back?</strong> Wilson may not have been a huge impact player for the Patriots over the last two seasons, but he has provided a steady presence at multiple spots on defense and special teams. There is value in that, especially for a player who was on a clear upward trajectory in 2023, will be relatively affordable, is still young, and also offers experience in the system. All those points work in favor of a return.</p>\n<p id=\"JrufD3\"><strong>Why should he be expected to leave?</strong> Wilson has yet to emerge past rotational status two seasons into his Patriots tenure, which in turn might impact how the team values him. Somebody else coming in with a more attractive offer both financially and in terms of role might be enough to convince the 26-year-old to leave New England.</p>\n<p id=\"FH17Rd\"><strong>What is his projected free agency outcome?</strong> With Josh Uche and Anfernee Jennings also headed for free agency, the Patriots face considerable questions on their edge. And while Wilson is not the same type of player &#8212; or at least was not used in the same fashion &#8212; keeping him around would make sense regardless of what happens with the two youngsters; he has shown he can play solid football on a team whose roster is not overflowing with edge depth and special teams talent. A two-year deal at a slightly increased annual value totaling $4.8 million seems like a fair one for both sides.</p>\n<p id=\"Ck1DnJ\">What do you think about Mack Wilson heading into free agency? Will he return to the Patriots as a free agent? Or will another team pick him up? Please head down to the comment section to discuss.</p>\n<p id=\"YcXCtG\"></p>\n  \n</div>",

Wilson, a rotational linebacker and edge defender, has provided steady contributions on defense and special teams during his two seasons with the Patriots. While he has not become a major impact player, his versatility, experience in the system, and affordability suggest he could return to New England. However, Wilson's future depends on how the team values him and whether he receives more lucrative offers elsewhere."

They owned the league’s lowest-graded run-defense unit and linebacker room in 2023.\n\nBaltimore’s Patrick Queen will be just 25 years old at the start of next season and has gotten substantially better over the past two seasons, setting career-high marks in run-defense and coverage grades in 2023. Given the relatively weak group of linebackers in the 2024 draft class, Queen is a logical option for Arizona.\n\nAtlanta’s free agency budget may heavily depend on whether the recent rumors linking them to Kirk Cousins are true. Finding a viable starting quarterback should be their top priority. Not far behind, though, is the need to fortify a defense that finished 27th in pass-rush grade this past season.\n\nBryce Huff was a rotational player for the Jets, but he was an absolute weapon off the edge. He finished tied for ninth in the NFL in pass-rush grade and trailed only Myles Garrett and Micah Parsons in pass-rush win rate. The Falcons could offer Huff the chance to play close to full time if they can afford him.\n\nAfter franchise-tagging Justin Madubuike, the Ravens sit nearly $10 million over the salary cap. They will be working on a tight budget but need to build up their edge defender group with Jadeveon Clowney and Kyle Van Noy hitting free agency.\n\nChase Young could be an option, as he is currently projected to sign a one-year prove-it contract to reestablish his market next year. He performed reasonably well in his first full season off a torn ACL but hasn’t yet lived up to his lofty draft status. Baltimore has a long history of handing veteran pass rushers one-year contracts, and Young could be next in line.\n\nThe Bills currently have the worst cap situation in the NFL, needing to clear more than $40 million before the start of the new league year. They have several needs, including running back, wide receiver and defensive line, that need to be addressed, but they likely won’t be eyeing the top of the market at any of those spots.\n\nWhile there are flashier names available at the running back position, such as Derrick Henry and Saquon Barkley, a reunion with Devin Singletary would make some sense. He had an excellent year in Houston, wrestling the starting role away from Dameon Pierce. The Bills shuffled through several players for depth last year. Singletary is still one of the best gap-scheme runners in the league and would add stability behind James Cook.\n\nCarolina needs to bring in fresh talent at nearly every spot on offense. They are set at tackle with Ikem Ekwonu and Taylor Moton, but they could stand to add weapons in a receiver-heavy draft. They would also be wise to use the free agency period to add desperately needed interior offensive line help in front of Bryce Young.\n\nCarolina’s guards ranked last in the NFL in overall grade in 2023, so signing Los Angeles’ Kevin Dotson would be a massive move. Dotson had a tremendous breakout year, ranking second in the NFL in overall and run-blocking grades while posting a respectable 66.8 pass-blocking grade.\n\nThe Bears have a golden opportunity to add talent at quarterback, wide receiver and edge defender in the upcoming draft. With more than $56 million in cap space to work with, they should look to add to a defensive tackle group that ranked 29th in the NFL in overall grade in 2023.\n\nJustin Madubuike has been franchise-tagged in Baltimore, and it’s widely assumed that the Chiefs will find a way to keep Chris Jones. That leaves Miami’s Christian Wilkins, PFF’s seventh-ranked free agent, as the best available interior defender. Wilkins finished 2023 with the ninth-most pressures and fifth-most sacks at the position last season.\n\nThe math is simple: When DJ Reader is on the field, the Bengals have a very good to excellent run defense. When he is not, they don’t. Reader’s ability to plug gaps when the Bengals play an odd front is incredibly valuable. He has also improved as a pass rusher over the past two years.\n\nReader’s value may also be lower after his season ended early due to a torn quad. He still finished the campaign as one of just five defensive tackles with top-15 grades in run defense and the pass rush. A reunion makes sense for all parties, with the hope that Reader fully recovers from his injury.\n\nThe Browns are currently working with just under $7 million in cap space and will continue to work amid a tight budget for the duration of the Deshaun Watson contract. Two areas stand out where the Browns need to improve: receiving and run defense.\n\nWe’ll side with improving the latter in free agency, given the cheaper market for run defenders and the deep wide receiver draft class. Tennessee’s Azeez Al-Shaair would offer a physical presence at linebacker that the Browns don’t currently have. Their linebackers ranked 27th in run-defense grade last season, and Al-Shaair could improve the room as a specialist in the same manner that someone like Leo Chenal does in Kansas City.\n\nDallas has some decisions to make on Dak Prescott and Michael Gallup before they can begin to look externally for reinforcements. With several needs on both sides of the ball, it will be interesting to see where the Cowboys’ priorities lie.\n\nOne should be improving a run defense that has often let them down in big spots. Indianapolis’ Grover Stewart should be on the Cowboys' radar after he posted a career-high 77.3 run-defense grade in 2023. He has earned at least a 65.0 run-defense grade in all seven seasons of his career. DeMarcus Lawrence was the only Cowboys defensive lineman with at least a 70.0 run-defense grade this past season.\n\nThe Broncos’ salary cap situation is a verifiable nightmare, given the impending release of Russell Wilson. They have a ton of roster holes to fill, including at quarterback. They may attack that position in the draft, but they also need to fix a coverage unit that looked like the backbone of their team as recently as 2022.\n\nThe bargain bin is likely the way to go while they hope for a rebound from Patrick Surtain II. Carolina recently released cornerback Donte Jackson. On the surface, he isn’t much of an improvement over Denver’s incumbents, but he may be a good system fit for a team that deploys man coverage at a reasonably high rate.\n\nThe Lions’ offense is ready to win a Super Bowl. Their defensive line has a lot of talent, even if it is a tad top-heavy. The secondary is where they need reinforcements. They ranked 30th in coverage grade last season and were last by a wide margin after Week 5.\n\nLike last year, the Lions enter free agency needing help at cornerback. Houston’s Steven Nelson profiles as someone who can help. Detroit deploys a reasonably high amount of man coverage, and Nelson has placed inside the top 20 in man coverage grade in each of the past three seasons. Nelson won’t fix all of their issues alone, but his addition would be a nice starting point.\n\nThe Packers are extremely thin at safety. Anthony Johnson Jr. is their only player at that position who played legitimate snaps in 2023 and is signed for 2024. New defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley, who previously served as Boston College's head coach, is likely to want somebody roving the backend in a defense that used as many single-high looks as any in college football last season.\n\nXavier McKinney fits that bill after playing in a similarly aggressive defense in New York. McKinney finished 2023 leading all safeties with a 91.2 coverage grade. McKinney displayed fantastic range and versatility time and again last season and would be a long-term solution who enters the 2024 season at just 26 years old.\n\nDeMeco Ryans worked a borderline miracle last season to turn Houston’s defense into a very respectable unit. Now, they just need to build around young stars like Will Anderson Jr. and Derek Stingley Jr. A bookend to Anderson up front would be a good place to start.\n\nJonathan Greenard may be departing in free agency, leaving a void on the edge, but the Texans have plenty of cap space to go after Minnesota’s Danielle Hunter. Hunter is currently the top edge defender available in PFF’s free agent rankings. He finished the 2023 regular season with the ninth-most pressures in the NFL and would create a fearsome tandem with Anderson.\n\nThe Colts finished this past season ranked 22nd in coverage grade. They are extremely young at cornerback and may attack that position early in the upcoming draft. In the meantime, they should likely prioritize retaining their highest-graded cover man for the near future.\n\nKenny Moore II led Indianapolis with a 79.3 coverage grade while manning the slot in 2023. He is coming off his best season yet is currently projected to make less than $7 million annually from his next contract. This is likely due to him now being on the wrong side of 30 years old, but Moore was a constant in coverage this past season for the Colts. Keeping him around on a reasonable deal while Indianapolis supplements its secondary with young talent would be a wise move.\n\nOffensive line struggles derailed Jacksonville’s postseason hopes last season. Injuries ravaged the unit, which finished with the third-lowest overall grade in the NFL. Jacksonville likely needs to find multiple solutions to help protect Trevor Lawrence and jumpstart the running game.\n\nNew England’s Mike Onwenu should be one of those solutions. He’s most comfortable at right tackle but also has plenty of experience at guard. The Jaguars may do some shuffling if they cut Cam Robinson and/or Brandon Scherff. Anton Harrison could move back to his natural position on the left side, as well. Either way, Onwenu would be a fit based on his prior production, versatility and prowess in Doug Pederson’s inside-zone run game.\n\nLikely the most obvious match on this list, the Chiefs can’t allow their future Hall-of-Fame defensive tackle to leave. Jones was outstanding again this past year, posting a 90.0 pass-rush grade for the fifth time in his past six seasons. He is, by far, the Chiefs’ most indispensable player on defense.\n\nJones may demand as much as $30 million per year on his next deal, which would take some cap maneuvering from the Chiefs. Kansas City currently has roughly $3.5 million in cap space. A L’Jarius Sneed trade would clear almost another $20 million, and then potential cuts of players like Charles Omenihu or Justin Reid may need to occur. Such moves are necessary when trying to retain one of the best players in the sport.\n\nThe Raiders' offensive backfield is in a state of flux. They have holes at quarterback and running back and currently stand to lose three of their five starting offensive linemen. They may be wise to focus on retaining the youngest of those three linemen.\n\nAndre James finished 2023 with a 74.6 overall grade, ranking ninth among qualified centers. He’ll be just 27 years old for the entire 2024 season and is equally adept in the pass and run games. His presence would allow the Raiders to figure out their holes elsewhere while not sacrificing production along the interior.\n\nThe Chargers’ financial situation isn’t pretty, as they currently sit nearly $20 million over the cap. They’ll have to make tough decisions on veteran players, potentially including defensive stalwarts Joey Bosa and Khalil Mack.\n\nOne player they should find a way to keep is safety Alohi Gilman. He finished 2023 with an 86.1 overall grade. That mark ranked second on the team, behind Mack, and seventh among qualified NFL safeties. PFF's contract projection would pay Gilman less than $3 million annually, so the Chargers have no reason to let such a productive player depart.\n\nThe Rams finished last in the NFL in team coverage grade (46.2) this past season. Only three teams had more snaps played in the secondary by first- and second-year players. Those players should improve with experience, but the Rams could contend with some immediate improvement on the backend.\n\nA reunion with the recently released Darious Williams would help. He finished 2023 with an 85.3 coverage grade, tied for fifth in the NFL. He also finished the season with a top-five zone coverage grade, making him a seamless fit in Los Angeles’ defense, and ranked second with 15 pass breakups.\n\nEven after cutting cornerback Xavien Howard, the Dolphins still need to clear nearly $19 million off the books before free agency starts. They have needs on the offensive line and in the secondary and endured a ton of defensive injuries this past season.\n\nOne player they should hope to retain is center Connor Williams. He finished 2023 as the league's second-highest-graded center and is a perfect fit in Mike McDaniel’s zone running game. Unfortunately, he suffered a torn ACL in Week 14, and his presence was sorely missed. That injury may keep Williams in Miami’s price range. The Dolphins can ill-afford to lose Williams and right guard Robert Hunt.\n\nThe Vikings’ quarterback situation is in flux with Kirk Cousins hitting free agency. They are said to be monitoring Baker Mayfield’s situation, but the most likely solution for that position could be a draft prospect. For now, we'll focus on how Brian Flores can further improve his defense.\n\nFlores’ presence could be a factor in adding a versatile edge player like Andrew Van Ginkel in free agency. Flores and his regime drafted Van Ginkel in Miami back in 2019, and he found a gem. Van Ginkel finished 2023 ranking seventh among edge defenders in overall and pass-rush grades. He’s also athletic enough to effectively drop into coverage. He would give Flores another chess piece to play with in an ascending defense.\n\nThe Patriots have a ton of cap space — nearly $89 million — and a desperate need for weapons. It seems likely that they will draft a new franchise quarterback with the third overall pick in the upcoming draft. They should use free agency to sign one, or multiple, top-flight weapons.\n\nJacksonville’s Calvin Ridley qualifies. He posted a 1,000-yard season after nearly two years away from the game. He is likely the best all-around wide receiver left on the market after Tee Higgins and Michael Pittman Jr. received franchise tags. Ridley doesn’t offer much after the catch but is still a solid vertical threat. New England needs talent, and Ridley is better than any receiver on the team's roster.\n\nThe Saints are cash-strapped, as is tradition at this point. They are currently around $17 million over the cap and need help in the trenches on both sides of the ball. The front office could look toward cheaper veteran options.\n\nBaltimore’s Kevin Zeitler stands out after earning an 82.3 pass-blocking grade in his age-33 season. His run-blocking grade is less impressive, but he is still a solid zone blocker, which would make him an asset in Klint Kubiak’s incoming system.\n\nOffensive line injuries plagued the Giants in 2023 after their run game led them to a postseason appearance in 2022. They are set at left tackle with Andrew Thomas. They’ll likely give Evan Neal and John Michael Schmitz extended chances at right tackle and center, respectively, though there have been whispers of them eyeing the top offensive tackle prospects in this year’s draft.\n\nWhat would help in the immediate future is stability at guard. The Giants have a reasonable amount of cap room and could add a stable pass protector like Dalton Risner. He didn’t allow a sack in 12 appearances this past season and has posted at least a 67.4 pass-blocking grade in each of his five NFL seasons.\n\nThe Jets need offensive line help like fish need water. Their season was derailed after just four snaps when Aaron Rodgers suffered a torn Achilles while being sacked. Their offensive line finished with the second-worst overall grade in the NFL.\n\nLuckily, Tyron Smith, who led all qualified linemen with in PFF pass-blocking grade (89.3), is available. The Jets should move mountains to acquire Smith, even if they plan on selecting a tackle in this year’s draft. While they also have needs at wide receiver and safety, nothing will matter until they create stability up front. Signing Smith would be a huge first step.\n\nThe Eagles had major issues in coverage all season after losing several starters from their outstanding 2022 squad. Regression from incumbent players also hurt, and the result was a defense left in disarray by the end of the season. New defensive coordinator Vic Fangio arrives with eyes on rebuilding a formerly elite unit.\n\nLuring cornerback Kendall Fuller away from the division foe Commanders would be a nice start. Fuller finished this past season with a top-10 coverage grade. He’s also finished inside the top five in zone coverage grade in each of the past two seasons, an important trait in Fangio’s defense. Fuller is fully capable of playing in the slot, as well, where the Eagles have struggled to defend over the past couple of seasons.\n\nMuch is being said about the Steelers’ quarterback situation this offseason. Regardless of who is throwing the ball, they won’t stand a chance to succeed unless their offensive line significantly improves. The draft figures to be a place to find reinforcements, but they should still look for veteran help.\n\nPittsburgh recently cut starting center Mason Cole, leaving the spot up for grabs. Denver’s Lloyd Cushenberry III could be a nice fit in Arthur Smith’s outside-zone run game if the Steelers can afford him. Cushenberry posted a solid 84.6 run-blocking grade when running outside zone in 2023, the sixth-best mark among all centers.\n\nThe 49ers currently sit just above the salary cap and have some improvements to make in the trenches and the secondary. Production on the right side of their offensive line has been a problem over the past two seasons.\n\nDetroit’s Graham Glasgow isn’t a long-term solution, but he is still an excellent zone run blocker and would provide improved pass protection at right guard in front of Brock Purdy. Glasgow also has extensive experience at center if the 49ers feel they need him there. Adding stability to the offensive line has been a theme on this list, and Glasgow would at least temporarily provide that for San Francisco.\n\nThe Seahawks have major needs in the trenches and just cleared more than $20 million in cap space by cutting safeties Jamal Adams and Quandre Diggs. A good chunk of those financial resources should go toward improving their interior offensive line.\n\nMiami’s Robert Hunt is looking for a payday after finishing 2023 with the sixth-best grade among qualified guards. He was one of just three guards to post at least a 74.0 grade in run blocking and pass blocking. He would be a welcome addition to Ryan Grubb’s new offense.\n\nMike Evans got his extension. Antoine Winfield Jr. got the franchise tag. Now, the Buccaneers need to solidify their quarterback situation. Their 26th overall draft position isn’t optimal when it comes to picking from a potentially electric quarterback class, so their best move would be to re-sign Baker Mayfield.\n\nThis move would likely require some tough decisions regarding Chris Godwin or Carlton Davis, but Mayfield has to stay. He provided the leadership Tampa Bay needed while finishing the regular season with 28 touchdown passes, the seventh most in the NFL. He was also outstanding in the postseason, outside of his late interception against Detroit.\n\nTennessee has a lot of needs and a lot of resources. Currently armed with the third-most cap space in the NFL and the seventh overall pick in the upcoming draft, the Titans are in a position to add premier talent to their roster.\n\nDeep-threat wide receiver Gabe Davis would pair nicely with Will Levis’ bazooka arm. Levis led the NFL in average depth of target by a wide margin in 2023. Davis owns a career 95.2 receiving grade on deep targets, a top-15 mark at the position since he entered the league.\n\nDan Quinn has a monumental task in front of him in fixing the Commanders’ defense. That unit allowed the most points in the NFL and finished with the third-worst overall grade. Finding young cornerstones will be a top priority for Quinn in his first year in Washington.\n\nOne of the few bright spots is safety Kamren Curl. He took a step back after a stellar 2022 but still had a respectable season amid the discourse taking place around him. Before the team started selling pieces off after Week 8, Curl owned the 11th-best overall grade among qualified safeties. He’ll be just 25 years old next season. Quinn should make his retention a priority.",

They owned the league&#8217;s lowest-graded run-defense unit and linebacker room in 2023.</p>\n<p>Baltimore&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/patrick-queen/57941\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Patrick Queen</a> will be just 25 years old at the start of next season and has gotten substantially better over the past two seasons, setting career-high marks in run-defense and coverage grades in 2023. Given the relatively weak group of linebackers in the 2024 draft class, Queen is a logical option for Arizona.</p>\n\n \n<p>Atlanta&#8217;s free agency budget may heavily depend on whether the recent rumors linking them to <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/kirk-cousins/7102\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kirk Cousins</a> are true. Finding a viable starting quarterback should be their top priority. Not far behind, though, is the need to fortify a defense that finished 27th in pass-rush grade this past season.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/bryce-huff/27128\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bryce Huff</a> was a rotational player for the Jets, but he was an absolute weapon off the edge. He finished tied for ninth in the NFL in pass-rush grade and trailed only <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/myles-garrett/11756\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Myles Garrett</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/micah-parsons/81360\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Micah Parsons</a> in pass-rush win rate. The Falcons could offer Huff the chance to play close to full time if they can afford him.</p>\n\n \n<p>After franchise-tagging <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/justin-madubuike/44304\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Justin Madubuike</a>, the Ravens sit nearly $10 million over the salary cap. They will be working on a tight budget but need to build up their edge defender group with <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/jadeveon-clowney/8636\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jadeveon Clowney</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/kyle-van-noy/8675\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kyle Van Noy</a> hitting free agency.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/chase-young/56436\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chase Young</a> could be an option, as he is currently projected to sign a one-year prove-it contract to reestablish his market next year. He performed reasonably well in his first full season off a torn ACL but hasn&#8217;t yet lived up to his lofty draft status. Baltimore has a long history of handing veteran pass rushers one-year contracts, and Young could be next in line.</p>\n\n \n<p>The Bills currently have the worst cap situation in the NFL, needing to clear more than $40 million before the start of the new league year. They have several needs, including running back, wide receiver and defensive line, that need to be addressed, but they likely won&#8217;t be eyeing the top of the market at any of those spots.</p>\n<p>While there are flashier names available at the running back position, such as <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/derrick-henry/10679\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Derrick Henry</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/saquon-barkley/45791\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Saquon Barkley</a>, a reunion with <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/devin-singletary/40485\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Devin Singletary</a> would make some sense. He had an excellent year in Houston, wrestling the starting role away from <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/dameon-pierce/83659\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dameon Pierce</a>. The Bills shuffled through several players for depth last year. Singletary is still one of the best gap-scheme runners in the league and would add stability behind <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/james-cook/83666\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">James Cook</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pff.com/draft/nfl-mock-draft-simulator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-523326\" src=\"https://media.pff.com/2024/03/28.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2555\" height=\"777\"></a></p>\n\n \n<p>Carolina needs to bring in fresh talent at nearly every spot on offense. They are set at tackle with <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/ikem-ekwonu/98286\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ikem Ekwonu</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/taylor-moton/11819\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Taylor Moton</a>, but they could stand to add weapons in a receiver-heavy draft. They would also be wise to use the free agency period to add desperately needed interior offensive line help in front of <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/bryce-young/123943\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bryce Young</a>.</p>\n<p>Carolina&#8217;s guards ranked last in the NFL in overall grade in 2023, so signing Los Angeles&#8217; <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/kevin-dotson/46735\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kevin Dotson</a> would be a massive move. Dotson had a tremendous breakout year, ranking second in the NFL in overall and run-blocking grades while posting a respectable 66.8 pass-blocking grade.</p>\n\n \n<p>The Bears have a golden opportunity to add talent at quarterback, wide receiver and edge defender in the upcoming draft. With more than $56 million in cap space to work with, they should look to add to a defensive tackle group that ranked 29th in the NFL in overall grade in 2023.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/justin-madubuike/44304\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Justin Madubuike</a> has been franchise-tagged in Baltimore, and it&#8217;s widely assumed that the Chiefs will find a way to keep <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/chris-jones/10671\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chris Jones</a>. That leaves Miami&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/christian-wilkins/50293\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Christian Wilkins</a>, PFF&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/free-agency?season=2024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>seventh-ranked free agent</strong></a>, as the best available interior defender. Wilkins finished 2023 with the ninth-most pressures and fifth-most sacks at the position last season.</p>\n\n \n<p>The math is simple: When <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/dj-reader/10800\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DJ Reader</a> is on the field, the Bengals have a very good to excellent run defense. When he is not, they don&#8217;t. Reader&#8217;s ability to plug gaps when the Bengals play an odd front is incredibly valuable. He has also improved as a pass rusher over the past two years.</p>\n<p>Reader&#8217;s value may also be lower after his season ended early due to a torn quad. He still finished the campaign as one of just five defensive tackles with top-15 grades in run defense and the pass rush. A reunion makes sense for all parties, with the hope that Reader fully recovers from his injury.</p>\n\n \n<p>The Browns are currently working with just under $7 million in cap space and will continue to work amid a tight budget for the duration of the <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/deshaun-watson/11767\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deshaun Watson</a> contract. Two areas stand out where the Browns need to improve: receiving and run defense.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll side with improving the latter in free agency, given the cheaper market for run defenders and the deep wide receiver draft class. Tennessee&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/azeez-al-shaair/49792\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Azeez Al-Shaair</a> would offer a physical presence at linebacker that the Browns don&#8217;t currently have. Their linebackers ranked 27th in run-defense grade last season, and Al-Shaair could improve the room as a specialist in the same manner that someone like <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/leo-chenal/101463\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Leo Chenal</a> does in Kansas City.</p>\n\n \n<p>Dallas has some decisions to make on <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/dak-prescott/10769\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dak Prescott</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/michael-gallup/26075\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Michael Gallup</a> before they can begin to look externally for reinforcements. With several needs on both sides of the ball, it will be interesting to see where the Cowboys&#8217; priorities lie.</p>\n<p>One should be improving a run defense that has often let them down in big spots. Indianapolis&#8217; <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/grover-stewart/11899\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Grover Stewart</a> should be on the Cowboys' radar after he posted a career-high 77.3 run-defense grade in 2023. He has earned at least a 65.0 run-defense grade in all seven seasons of his career. <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/demarcus-lawrence/8669\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DeMarcus Lawrence</a> was the only Cowboys defensive lineman with at least a 70.0 run-defense grade this past season.</p>\n\n \n<p>The Broncos&#8217; salary cap situation is a verifiable nightmare, given the impending release of <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/russell-wilson/7077\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Russell Wilson</a>. They have a ton of roster holes to fill, including at quarterback. They may attack that position in the draft, but they also need to fix a coverage unit that looked like the backbone of their team as recently as 2022.</p>\n<p>The bargain bin is likely the way to go while they hope for a rebound from <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/patrick-surtain/83119\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Patrick Surtain II</a>. Carolina recently released cornerback <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/donte-jackson/49377\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Donte Jackson</a>. On the surface, he isn&#8217;t much of an improvement over Denver&#8217;s incumbents, but he may be a good system fit for a team that deploys man coverage at a reasonably high rate.</p>\n\n \n<p>The Lions&#8217; offense is ready to win a Super Bowl. Their defensive line has a lot of talent, even if it is a tad top-heavy. The secondary is where they need reinforcements. They ranked 30th in coverage grade last season and were last by a wide margin after Week 5.</p>\n<p>Like last year, the Lions enter free agency needing help at cornerback. Houston&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/steven-nelson/9531\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Steven Nelson</a> profiles as someone who can help. Detroit deploys a reasonably high amount of man coverage, and Nelson has placed inside the top 20 in man coverage grade in each of the past three seasons. Nelson won&#8217;t fix all of their issues alone, but his addition would be a nice starting point.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pff.com/draft/nfl-mock-draft-simulator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-523327\" src=\"https://media.pff.com/2024/03/29.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2555\" height=\"777\"></a></p>\n\n \n<p>The Packers are extremely thin at safety. <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/anthony-johnson/55628\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anthony Johnson</a><a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/anthony-johnson/76736\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Jr.</a> is their only player at that position who played legitimate snaps in 2023 and is signed for 2024. New defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley, who previously served as Boston College's head coach, is likely to want somebody roving the backend in a defense that used as many single-high looks as any in college football last season.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/xavier-mckinney/55775\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Xavier McKinney</a> fits that bill after playing in a similarly aggressive defense in New York. McKinney finished 2023 leading all safeties with a 91.2 coverage grade. McKinney displayed fantastic range and versatility time and again last season and would be a long-term solution who enters the 2024 season at just 26 years old.</p>\n\n \n<p>DeMeco Ryans worked a borderline miracle last season to turn Houston&#8217;s defense into a very respectable unit. Now, they just need to build around young stars like <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/will-anderson/123903\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Will Anderson Jr.</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/derek-stingley/98253\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Derek Stingley Jr.</a> A bookend to Anderson up front would be a good place to start.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/jonathan-greenard/48407\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jonathan Greenard</a> may be departing in free agency, leaving a void on the edge, but the Texans have plenty of cap space to go after Minnesota&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/danielle-hunter/9521\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Danielle Hunter</a>. Hunter is currently the top edge defender available in <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>PFF&#8217;s free agent rankings</strong></a>. He finished the 2023 regular season with the ninth-most pressures in the NFL and would create a fearsome tandem with Anderson.</p>\n\n \n<p>The Colts finished this past season ranked 22nd in coverage grade. They are extremely young at cornerback and may attack that position early in the upcoming draft. In the meantime, they should likely prioritize retaining their highest-graded cover man for the near future.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/kenny-moore/51596\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kenny Moore II</a> led Indianapolis with a 79.3 coverage grade while manning the slot in 2023. He is coming off his best season yet is <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/free-agency?season=2024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>currently projected</strong></a> to make less than $7 million annually from his next contract. This is likely due to him now being on the wrong side of 30 years old, but Moore was a constant in coverage this past season for the Colts. Keeping him around on a reasonable deal while Indianapolis supplements its secondary with young talent would be a wise move.</p>\n\n \n<p>Offensive line struggles derailed Jacksonville&#8217;s postseason hopes last season. Injuries ravaged the unit, which finished with the third-lowest overall grade in the NFL. Jacksonville likely needs to find multiple solutions to help protect <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/trevor-lawrence/77632\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Trevor Lawrence</a> and jumpstart the running game.</p>\n<p>New England&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/michael-onwenu/27357\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mike Onwenu</a> should be one of those solutions. He&#8217;s most comfortable at right tackle but also has plenty of experience at guard. The Jaguars may do some shuffling if they cut <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/cam-robinson/11789\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cam Robinson</a> and/or <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/brandon-scherff/9438\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brandon Scherff</a>. <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/anton-harrison/122929\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anton Harrison</a> could move back to his natural position on the left side, as well. Either way, Onwenu would be a fit based on his prior production, versatility and prowess in Doug Pederson&#8217;s inside-zone run game.</p>\n\n \n<p>Likely the most obvious match on this list, the Chiefs can&#8217;t allow their future Hall-of-Fame defensive tackle to leave. Jones was outstanding again this past year, posting a 90.0 pass-rush grade for the fifth time in his past six seasons. He is, by far, the Chiefs&#8217; most indispensable player on defense.</p>\n<p>Jones may demand as much as $30 million per year on his next deal, which would take some cap maneuvering from the Chiefs. Kansas City currently has roughly $3.5 million in cap space. A <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/ljarius-sneed/40588\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">L&#8217;Jarius Sneed</a> trade would clear almost another $20 million, and then potential cuts of players like <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/charles-omenihu/50612\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Charles Omenihu</a> or <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/justin-reid/49048\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Justin Reid</a> may need to occur. Such moves are necessary when trying to retain one of the best players in the sport.</p>\n\n \n<p>The Raiders' offensive backfield is in a state of flux. They have holes at quarterback and running back and currently stand to lose three of their five starting offensive linemen. They may be wise to focus on retaining the youngest of those three linemen.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/andre-james/47058\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Andre James</a> finished 2023 with a 74.6 overall grade, ranking ninth among qualified centers. He&#8217;ll be just 27 years old for the entire 2024 season and is equally adept in the pass and run games. His presence would allow the Raiders to figure out their holes elsewhere while not sacrificing production along the interior.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pff.com/draft/nfl-mock-draft-simulator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-523311\" src=\"https://media.pff.com/2024/03/13.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2555\" height=\"777\"></a></p>\n\n \n<p>The Chargers&#8217; financial situation isn&#8217;t pretty, as they currently sit nearly $20 million over the cap. They&#8217;ll have to make tough decisions on veteran players, potentially including defensive stalwarts <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/joey-bosa/10637\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Joey Bosa</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/khalil-mack/8640\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Khalil Mack</a>.</p>\n<p>One player they should find a way to keep is safety <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/alohi-gilman/41662\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alohi Gilman</a>. He finished 2023 with an 86.1 overall grade. That mark ranked second on the team, behind Mack, and seventh among qualified NFL safeties. PFF's <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/free-agency?season=2024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>contract projection</strong></a> would pay Gilman less than $3 million annually, so the Chargers have no reason to let such a productive player depart.</p>\n\n \n<p>The Rams finished last in the NFL in team coverage grade (46.2) this past season. Only three teams had more snaps played in the secondary by first- and second-year players. Those players should improve with experience, but the Rams could contend with some immediate improvement on the backend.</p>\n<p>A reunion with the recently released <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/darious-williams/55724\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Darious Williams</a> would help. He finished 2023 with an 85.3 coverage grade, tied for fifth in the NFL. He also finished the season with a top-five zone coverage grade, making him a seamless fit in Los Angeles&#8217; defense, and ranked second with 15 pass breakups.</p>\n\n \n<p>Even after cutting cornerback <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/xavien-howard/10672\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Xavien Howard</a>, the Dolphins still need to clear nearly $19 million off the books before free agency starts. They have needs on the offensive line and in the secondary and endured a ton of defensive injuries this past season.</p>\n<p>One player they should hope to retain is center <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/connor-williams/46216\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Connor Williams</a>. He finished 2023 as the league's second-highest-graded center and is a perfect fit in Mike McDaniel&#8217;s zone running game. Unfortunately, he suffered a torn ACL in Week 14, and his presence was sorely missed. That injury may keep Williams in Miami&#8217;s price range. The Dolphins can ill-afford to lose Williams and right guard <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/robert-hunt/46139\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Robert Hunt</a>.</p>\n\n \n<p>The Vikings&#8217; quarterback situation is in flux with <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/kirk-cousins/7102\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kirk Cousins</a> hitting free agency. They are said to be monitoring <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/baker-mayfield/46518\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Baker Mayfield</a>&#8217;s situation, but the most likely solution for that position could be a draft prospect. For now, we'll focus on how Brian Flores can further improve his defense.</p>\n<p>Flores&#8217; presence could be a factor in adding a versatile edge player like <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/andrew-van-ginkel/30267\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Andrew Van Ginkel</a> in free agency. Flores and his regime drafted Van Ginkel in Miami back in 2019, and he found a gem. Van Ginkel finished 2023 ranking seventh among edge defenders in overall and pass-rush grades. He&#8217;s also athletic enough to effectively drop into coverage. He would give Flores another chess piece to play with in an ascending defense.</p>\n\n \n<p>The Patriots have a ton of cap space &#8212; nearly $89 million &#8212; and a desperate need for weapons. It seems likely that they will draft a new franchise quarterback with the third overall pick in the upcoming draft. They should use free agency to sign one, or multiple, top-flight weapons.</p>\n<p>Jacksonville&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/calvin-ridley/48262\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Calvin Ridley</a> qualifies. He posted a 1,000-yard season after nearly two years away from the game. He is likely the best all-around wide receiver left on the market after <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/tee-higgins/61211\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tee Higgins</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/michael-pittman/29049\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Michael Pittman Jr.</a> received franchise tags. Ridley doesn&#8217;t offer much after the catch but is still a solid vertical threat. New England needs talent, and Ridley is better than any receiver on the team's roster.</p>\n\n \n<p>The Saints are cash-strapped, as is tradition at this point. They are currently around $17 million over the cap and need help in the trenches on both sides of the ball. The front office could look toward cheaper veteran options.</p>\n<p>Baltimore&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/kevin-zeitler/7032\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kevin Zeitler</a> stands out after earning an 82.3 pass-blocking grade in his age-33 season. His run-blocking grade is less impressive, but he is still a solid zone blocker, which would make him an asset in Klint Kubiak&#8217;s incoming system.</p>\n\n \n<p>Offensive line injuries plagued the Giants in 2023 after their run game led them to a postseason appearance in 2022. They are set at left tackle with <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/andrew-thomas/59701\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Andrew Thomas</a>. They&#8217;ll likely give <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/evan-neal/99063\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Evan Neal</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/john-michael-schmitz/55238\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">John Michael Schmitz</a> extended chances at right tackle and center, respectively, though there have been whispers of them eyeing the top offensive tackle prospects in this year&#8217;s draft.</p>\n<p>What would help in the immediate future is stability at guard. The Giants have a reasonable amount of cap room and could add a stable pass protector like <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/dalton-risner/47008\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dalton Risner</a>. He didn&#8217;t allow a sack in 12 appearances this past season and has posted at least a 67.4 pass-blocking grade in each of his five NFL seasons.</p>\n\n \n<p>The Jets need offensive line help like fish need water. Their season was derailed after just four snaps when <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/aaron-rodgers/2241\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Aaron Rodgers</a> suffered a torn Achilles while being sacked. Their offensive line finished with the second-worst overall grade in the NFL.</p>\n<p>Luckily, <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/tyron-smith/6161\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tyron Smith</a>, who led all qualified linemen with in PFF pass-blocking grade (89.3), is available. The Jets should move mountains to acquire Smith, even if they plan on selecting a tackle in this year&#8217;s draft. While they also have needs at wide receiver and safety, nothing will matter until they create stability up front. Signing Smith would be a huge first step.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pff.com/draft/nfl-mock-draft-simulator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-523308\" src=\"https://media.pff.com/2024/03/10.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2555\" height=\"777\"></a></p>\n\n \n<p>The Eagles had major issues in coverage all season after losing several starters from their outstanding 2022 squad. Regression from incumbent players also hurt, and the result was a defense left in disarray by the end of the season. New defensive coordinator Vic Fangio arrives with eyes on rebuilding a formerly elite unit.</p>\n<p>Luring cornerback <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/kendall-fuller/10718\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kendall Fuller</a> away from the division foe Commanders would be a nice start. Fuller finished this past season with a top-10 coverage grade. He&#8217;s also finished inside the top five in zone coverage grade in each of the past two seasons, an important trait in Fangio&#8217;s defense. Fuller is fully capable of playing in the slot, as well, where the Eagles have struggled to defend over the past couple of seasons.</p>\n\n \n<p>Much is being said about the Steelers&#8217; quarterback situation this offseason. Regardless of who is throwing the ball, they won&#8217;t stand a chance to succeed unless their offensive line significantly improves. The draft figures to be a place to find reinforcements, but they should still look for veteran help.</p>\n<p>Pittsburgh recently cut starting center <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/mason-cole/45547\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mason Cole</a>, leaving the spot up for grabs. Denver&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/lloyd-cushenberry/41924\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lloyd Cushenberry III</a> could be a nice fit in Arthur Smith&#8217;s outside-zone run game if the Steelers can afford him. Cushenberry posted a solid 84.6 run-blocking grade when running outside zone in 2023, the sixth-best mark among all centers.</p>\n\n \n<p>The 49ers currently sit just above the salary cap and have some improvements to make in the trenches and the secondary. Production on the right side of their offensive line has been a problem over the past two seasons.</p>\n<p>Detroit&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/graham-glasgow/10729\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Graham Glasgow</a> isn&#8217;t a long-term solution, but he is still an excellent zone run blocker and would provide improved pass protection at right guard in front of <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/brock-purdy/77672\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brock Purdy</a>. Glasgow also has extensive experience at center if the 49ers feel they need him there. Adding stability to the offensive line has been a theme on this list, and Glasgow would at least temporarily provide that for San Francisco.</p>\n\n \n<p>The Seahawks have major needs in the trenches and just cleared more than $20 million in cap space by cutting safeties <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/jamal-adams/11761\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jamal Adams</a> and <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/quandre-diggs/9633\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Quandre Diggs</a>. A good chunk of those financial resources should go toward improving their interior offensive line.</p>\n<p>Miami&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/robert-hunt/46139\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Robert Hunt</a> is looking for a payday after finishing 2023 with the sixth-best grade among qualified guards. He was one of just three guards to post at least a 74.0 grade in run blocking and pass blocking. He would be a welcome addition to Ryan Grubb&#8217;s new offense.</p>\n\n \n<p><a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/mike-evans/8642\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mike Evans</a> got his extension. <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/antoine-winfield/42475\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Antoine Winfield Jr.</a> got the franchise tag. Now, the Buccaneers need to solidify their quarterback situation. Their 26th overall draft position isn&#8217;t optimal when it comes to picking from a potentially electric quarterback class, so their best move would be to re-sign <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/baker-mayfield/46518\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Baker Mayfield</a>.</p>\n<p>This move would likely require some tough decisions regarding <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/chris-godwin/11839\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chris Godwin</a> or <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/carlton-davis/49335\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Carlton Davis</a>, but Mayfield has to stay. He provided the leadership Tampa Bay needed while finishing the regular season with 28 touchdown passes, the seventh most in the NFL. He was also outstanding in the postseason, outside of his late interception against Detroit.</p>\n\n \n<p>Tennessee has a lot of needs and a lot of resources. Currently armed with the third-most cap space in the NFL and the seventh overall pick in the upcoming draft, the Titans are in a position to add premier talent to their roster.</p>\n<p>Deep-threat wide receiver <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/gabriel-davis/55410\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gabe Davis</a> would pair nicely with <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/will-levis/83542\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Will Levis</a>&#8217; bazooka arm. Levis led the NFL in average depth of target by a wide margin in 2023. Davis owns a career 95.2 receiving grade on deep targets, a top-15 mark at the position since he entered the league.</p>\n\n \n<p>Dan Quinn has a monumental task in front of him in fixing the Commanders&#8217; defense. That unit allowed the most points in the NFL and finished with the third-worst overall grade. Finding young cornerstones will be a top priority for Quinn in his first year in Washington.</p>\n<p>One of the few bright spots is safety <a href=\"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/kamren-curl/55800\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kamren Curl</a>. He took a step back after a stellar 2022 but still had a respectable season amid the discourse taking place around him. Before the team started selling pieces off after Week 8, Curl owned the 11th-best overall grade among qualified safeties. He&#8217;ll be just 25 years old next season. Quinn should make his retention a priority.</p>\n\n                  </div>",

The event will be broadcast exclusively on Netflix and held at the 80,000-seat capacity AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, home of the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys.\n\n“Iron Mike,” 57, last fought professionally in June 2005 and boasts a 50-6 career record, with 44 of his victories coming by way of knockout. The former world heavyweight champion is widely considered one of the best boxers in history.\n\nThe 27-year-old Paul, meanwhile, has transitioned from YouTube to professional boxing and has won nine of his 10 fights. His only defeat came against Tommy Fury, the younger half-brother of heavyweight champion Tyson Fury, in February 2023.\n\n“My sights are set on becoming a world champion, and now I have a chance to prove myself against the greatest heavyweight champion ever, the baddest man on the planet and the most dangerous boxer of all time,” Paul said in a statement.\n\n“This will be the fight of a lifetime.”\n\nTyson – a member of the boxing Hall of Fame – came out of retirement to face Roy Jones Jr. in an exhibition match, which ended in a controversial split draw, in 2020. Paul beat former NBA player Nate Robinson on the undercard of that fight.\n\n“He’s grown significantly as a boxer over the years, so it will be a lot of fun to see what the will and ambition of a ‘kid’ can do with the experience and aptitude of a GOAT (greatest of all time),” Tyson said of Paul, per a statement.\n\n“It’s a full circle moment that will be beyond thrilling to watch; as I started him on his boxing journey on the undercard of my fight with Roy Jones and now I plan to finish him.”\n\nJake Paul's only defeat of his fledging career came against Tommy Fury in February 2023. Francois Nel/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nInternet personalities taking up boxing has come a long way in the last five years.\n\nEver since the first fights involving YouTube stars KSI and Joe Weller back in 2017, people from all walks of life – from TikTok to music – have slipped on the gloves and stepped into the ring, with the exhibition demographic of the sport growing rapidly.\n\nWhat seemingly started as a money-driven decision from Paul has since developed into an apparent love for boxing, with the social media personality working hard to be taken seriously by those within the sport.\n\nThe fight in July is likely to generate huge sums of money for both men and, in Tyson, will provide fans an opportunity to see one of the most dangerous fighters in history in the ring once again.",

Shutterstock / Pavel Masychev\n\nThe woolly mammoth went the way of the dodo bird about 4,000 years ago, and while the company wouldn’t bring back the same exact species, it would create an animal that has similar traits like a heavy fur coat and plenty of fat to withstand freezing temperatures.\n\n“It will walk like a Woolly Mammoth, look like one, sound like one, but most importantly it will be able to inhabit the same ecosystem previously abandoned by the Mammoth’s extinction,” the company said.\n\nThe company’s goal, however lofty, is to eventually genetically tinker a stem cell’s nucleus with genes from a mammoth, then merge that with an elephant egg, the Washington Post reported. Then the embryo would be placed in an elephant surrogate who would hopefully give birth.\n\nBut not everyone is on board with Colossal’s goal.\n\nA University of Sheffield paleontologist in England, Tori Herridge, warned any living elephant that gives birth to a new mammoth will face at least some level of suffering.\n\n“How many dead elephants are we willing to have to get one woolly one,” she told the Washington Post.\n\nCo-founder George Church says the step was a major breakthrough.\n\nAnother scientist bluntly called it “irresponsible.”\n\n“What are you going to get out of this?” Karl Flessa, a geosciences professor at the University of Arizona, told NPR.\n\n“First of all, I think you’re going to get a bit of a freak show in a zoo somewhere.

                        "newstext": "A company aiming to bring extinct animals back from the dead said it has taken an elephant-sized step toward genetically resurrecting the woolly mammoth, a wild if contentious goal to repopulate the Arctic tundra with a missing titan. Sign up for the Climate Coach newsletter and get advice for life on our changing planet, in your inbox every Tuesday. ArrowRight Colossal Biosciences, a biotechnology company based in Dallas, announced Wednesday it has produced a line of Asian elephant stem cells that can be coaxed to transform into other types of cells needed to reconstruct the extinct giant — or at a least a mammoth-like elephant designed to thrive in the cold.\n\n“It’s probably the most significant thing so far in the project,” said George Church, a Harvard geneticist and Colossal co-founder. “There are many steps in the future.”\n\nFor proponents, bringing back vanished animals is a chance to correct humanity’s role in the ongoing extinction crisis. Breakthroughs in their field, they say, may yield benefits for animals still with us, including endangered elephants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet the technical challenges of birthing into the world a living, breathing mammoth remain, well, colossal. And the project raises hairy ethical questions: Who decides what comes back? Where will the reborn species go? Could the money be better spent elsewhere? And how hard will “de-extinction,” as the revival efforts are known, be on the animals themselves?\n\n“The lack of knowledge is the thing that worries me about the welfare of animals,” said Heather Browning, a philosopher at the University of Southampton in England and a former zookeeper.\n\nCan we really bring back the mammoth?\n\nDuring the last ice age, the woolly mammoth owned the top of the world, plodding across Eurasia and North America and as far south as the modern-day Midwest.\n\nAs the creatures died out 4,000 years ago, some carcasses froze over in icy tundra that preserved not only their bones but also their flesh and fur, giving paleontologists the chance to collect DNA fragments. Some mammoth meat was so well kept that at least one adventurous researcher has eaten it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy 2015, scientists sequenced its genetic blueprint well enough to offer a potential manual for remaking a mammoth. But to test what exactly each of these genes do — which give the beast their curved tusks, fatty build and, of course, thick fur — Church wants elephant stem cells in which he could engineer mammoth DNA and grow tissue samples.\n\nScientists have produced such stem cells in the lab for other animals, including humans, mice, pigs and even rhinos. But for years, getting the right elephant stem cells to test all those cold-climate characteristics proved elusive, in part because elephant cells’ ability to avoid cancer made reprogramming them difficult.\n\nColossal said they have produced the stem cells they need by suppressing the anti-cancer genes and bathing the cells in the right chemical cocktail. Colossal published a preprint Wednesday that is not yet peer-reviewed. The company said it is working to place the study in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It hasn’t been straightforward,” said Eriona Hysolli, the company’s head of biological sciences. “It hasn’t been immediately obvious. There were a lot of innovations along the way.”\n\nJeanne Loring, a researcher at the Scripps Research in California who helped develop potent stem cells for the northern white rhinoceros, said the work showed the elephant researchers’ persistence. “This is an incredibly steep hill they have ahead,” she added. “The challenges get bigger and bigger with the size of the animal.”\n\nEventually, the company wants to genetically edit a nucleus of a stem cell with mammoth genes and fuse it into an elephant egg. From there, if everything goes according to plan — still a big if — they will implant the embryo in an elephant surrogate and wait for it to give birth.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nEven if we can, should we?\n\nMatthew Cobb, a zoologist at the University of Manchester in England, said all those “ifs” may be insurmountable. There is no guarantee that the modified chromosomes can be introduced to an elephant cell, or if that an embryo will take hold in an elephant womb.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd perhaps more profoundly, there is the question of how a mammoth, if born, will learn to behave like a mammoth. “Most of the mammals and birds that are being talked about have complex social and cultural interactions that have been lost,” Cobb said. “They are not simply their genes.”\n\nModern elephants, for instance, are highly social beings, passing down knowledge about the location of watering holes and other survival skills from one generation to the next. Their ancient cousins may be similar. “They’ve got no elders to raise them, to teach them,” Browning said. “They’re got no way of learning how to be mammoths.”\n\nAnd any living surrogate elephant meant to gestate and give birth to a new mammoth will go through some degree of hardship. “How many dead elephants are we willing to have to get one woolly one?” said Tori Herridge, a paleobiologist specializing in ancient elephants at the University of Sheffield in England.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColossal said its long-term goal is to use artificial wombs to gestate the animals, itself a tall technological task. The company notes that its research into elephant cells can help with current conversation efforts, such as potential treatments for a form of herpes that kills young elephants. Indeed, the company hopes to make money by licensing or selling some of the technologies it creates along the way.\n\n“It’s not so much bringing back the mammoth, it’s saving an endangered species,” Church said. “It’s working out technology that’s useful for conservation and climate change.”\n\nBut Cobb said the biggest threats facing elephants are hunting, habitat destruction and other conflicts with humans. “How will a greater understanding of cell biology help?”\n\nWhat if they go extinct again?\n\nOne of Colossal’s overarching arguments for bringing back the mammoth is climate change. Scientists at the company say future Arctic herds can stomp down permafrost and prevent more of it from thawing and releasing atmosphere-warming carbon into the air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“They’re a lot of reasons to restore that environment to what it was,” Church said. “This is the keystone species that’s missing for that.”\n\nThen there is this philosophical question: Is a bioengineered mammoth truly a mammoth? Or is it a furrier elephant that can tolerate the cold?\n\n“It’s a completely new organism that’s being created,” Herridge said. She added that it is still an open question as to what killed off the woolly mammoth: Was it humans overhunting them, or the natural end of the last ice age?

Some mammoth meat was so well kept that at least one adventurous researcher has eaten it.</p><p class=\"dib gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md\"></p><p>Advertisement</p><p class=\"wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy\" dir=\"null\">By 2015, scientists <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/04/24/de-extinction-and-the-wooly-mammoth-genome/?itid=lk_inline_manual_16\" target=\"_blank\">sequenced</a> its genetic blueprint well enough to offer a potential manual for remaking a mammoth.

But for years, getting the right elephant stem cells to test all those cold-climate characteristics proved elusive, in part because elephant cells&#8217; ability to avoid cancer made reprogramming them difficult.</p><p class=\"dib gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md\"></p><p class=\"flex flex-column justify-center font-sans-serif center font-xxs light gray-dark lh-md\"></p><p class=\"wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy\" dir=\"null\">Colossal said they have produced the stem cells they need by suppressing the anti-cancer genes and bathing the cells in the right chemical cocktail. Colossal published a preprint Wednesday that is not yet peer-reviewed. The company said it is working to place the study in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.</p><p class=\"dib gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md\"></p><p>Advertisement</p><p class=\"wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy\" dir=\"null\">&#8220;It hasn&#8217;t been straightforward,&#8221; said Eriona Hysolli, the company&#8217;s head of biological sciences. &#8220;It hasn&#8217;t been immediately obvious. There were a lot of innovations along the way.&#8221;</p><p class=\"wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy\" dir=\"null\">Jeanne Loring, a researcher at the Scripps Research in California who helped develop potent stem cells for the northern white rhinoceros, said the work showed the elephant researchers&#8217; persistence. &#8220;This is an incredibly steep hill they have ahead,&#8221; she added. &#8220;The challenges get bigger and bigger with the size of the animal.&#8221;</p><p class=\"dib gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md\"></p><p class=\"flex flex-column justify-center font-sans-serif center font-xxs light gray-dark lh-md\"></p><p class=\"wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy\" dir=\"null\">Eventually, the company wants to genetically edit a nucleus<b> </b>of a stem cell with mammoth genes and fuse it into an elephant egg.

There is no guarantee that the modified chromosomes can be introduced to an elephant cell, or if that an embryo will take hold in an elephant womb.</p><p class=\"dib gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md\"></p><p>Advertisement</p><p class=\"wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy\" dir=\"null\">And perhaps more profoundly, there is the question of how a mammoth, if born, will learn to behave like a mammoth. &#8220;Most of the mammals and birds that are being talked about have complex social and cultural interactions that have been lost,&#8221; Cobb said. &#8220;They are not simply their genes.&#8221;</p><p class=\"dib gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md\"></p><p class=\"flex flex-column justify-center font-sans-serif center font-xxs light gray-dark lh-md\"></p><p class=\"wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy\" dir=\"null\">Modern elephants, for instance, are highly social beings, passing down knowledge about the location of watering holes and other survival skills from one generation to the next. Their ancient cousins may be similar. &#8220;They&#8217;ve got no elders to raise them, to teach them,&#8221; Browning said. &#8220;They&#8217;re got no way of learning how to be mammoths.&#8221;</p><p class=\"wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy\" dir=\"null\">And any living surrogate elephant meant to gestate and give birth to a new mammoth will go through some degree of hardship. &#8220;How many dead elephants are we willing to have to get one woolly one?&#8221; said Tori Herridge, a paleobiologist specializing in ancient elephants at the University of Sheffield in England.</p><p class=\"dib gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md\"></p><p>Advertisement</p><p class=\"wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy\" dir=\"null\">Colossal said its long-term goal is to use artificial wombs to gestate the animals, itself a tall technological task. The company notes that its research into elephant cells can help with current conversation efforts, such as potential treatments for a form of herpes that kills young elephants. Indeed, the company hopes to make money by licensing or selling some of the technologies it creates along the way.</p><p class=\"dib gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md\"></p><p class=\"flex flex-column justify-center font-sans-serif center font-xxs light gray-dark lh-md\"></p><p class=\"wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy\" dir=\"null\">&#8220;It&#8217;s not so much bringing back the mammoth, it&#8217;s saving an endangered species,&#8221; Church said. &#8220;It&#8217;s working out technology that&#8217;s useful for conservation and climate change.&#8221;</p><p class=\"wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy\" dir=\"null\">But Cobb said the biggest threats facing elephants are hunting, habitat destruction and other conflicts with humans. &#8220;How will a greater understanding of cell biology help?&#8221;</p><h3 class=\" pb-sm pt-lgmod\" id=\"GBH7AZIRNNGQ7DJRKVFBAPS3BI\"><p>What if they go extinct again?</p></h3><p class=\"wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy\" dir=\"null\">One of Colossal&#8217;s overarching arguments for bringing back the mammoth is climate change. Scientists at the company say future Arctic herds can stomp down permafrost and prevent more of it from thawing and releasing atmosphere-warming carbon into the air.</p><p class=\"dib gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md\"></p><p>Advertisement</p><p class=\"wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy\" dir=\"null\">&#8220;They&#8217;re a lot of reasons to restore that environment to what it was,&#8221; Church said. &#8220;This is the keystone species that&#8217;s missing for that.&#8221;</p><p class=\"dib gray-dark pl-xs pr-xs font-sans-serif light font-xxxxs lh-md\"></p><p class=\"flex flex-column justify-center font-sans-serif center font-xxs light gray-dark lh-md\"></p><p class=\"wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy\" dir=\"null\">Then there is this philosophical question: Is a bioengineered mammoth truly a mammoth? Or is it a furrier elephant that can tolerate the cold?</p><p class=\"wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy\" dir=\"null\">&#8220;It&#8217;s a completely new organism that&#8217;s being created,&#8221; Herridge said. She added that it is still an open question as to what killed off the woolly mammoth: Was it humans overhunting them, or the natural end of the last ice age? If the answer is the latter, then the Arctic may be unsuitable for the resurrected creature, whatever you want to call it.</p><p class=\"wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy\" dir=\"null\">&#8220;I would love to see a mammoth alive,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I would absolutely love to have a time machine where I could go back to the ice age, and I could see a herd of mammoths being mammoths in the landscape in which they evolved.&#8221;</p><p class=\"wpds-c-cYdRxM wpds-c-cYdRxM-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy\" dir=\"null\">&#8220;But all of that has gone.&#8221;</p></div>",

                "newstext": "North America is preparing for a total solar eclipse on a never-before-seen scale.\n\nOn April 8 this year, millions of people in northern Mexico, the U.S. and southeastern Canada will experience totality — darkness in the day and the chance to see the sun's corona with the naked eye — yet few appreciate how rare and unique this event will be.\n\nHere's why it could be the best for hundreds of years — and for many years into the future:\n\nRelated: The best places in the US to experience totality during the April 2024 solar eclipse\n\n1. It will be the longest U.S total solar eclipse since 1806\n\nExperience this total solar eclipse from Mexico, you may be able to get 4 minutes and 28 seconds of totality. That will reduce as the moon's dark central shadow speeds up and becomes stretched as it moves from southwest to northeast, but on the U.S.-Mexico border, 4 minutes 26 seconds is possible.\n\nThe last time a totality of this length occurred in North America was on June 16, 1806 , when a total solar eclipse lasting up to 4 minutes 55 seconds surged across the U.S. from Baja California to Cape Cod via Albuquerque, Kansas City, Cleveland and Boston. It was promoted to Bostonians by the book Darkness At Noon . That event is also known as Tecumseh's Eclipse. According to eclipse-chaser Bill Kramer, two leaders of the Shawnee people predicted the eclipse and witnessed it from Greenville, Ohio — which on April 8 will experience totality for 3 minutes 55 seconds. It will be Ohio's first total solar eclipse since 1806.\n\n2. It will occur at solar maximum\n\nThe last time a total solar eclipse visible from North America coincided with solar maximum was on February 26, 1979 (Image credit: Stocktrek via Getty Images)\n\nAnyone who has seen the solar corona with their naked eyes during totality will know that it is always an utterly spectacular sight. During solar minimum — when our star's magnetic activity is at its lowest in its roughly 11-year cycle — it has an asymmetrical, thorny look, as it did during the last total solar eclipse in North America on August 21, 2017. That will not be the case on April 8, when the sun's corona will seem larger, more symmetrical and sunflower-like. It's a consequence of magnetic activity in the sun , and sometime this year, the sun is predicted to reach solar maximum .\n\nThe last time a total solar eclipse visible from North America coincided with solar maximum was on February 26, 1979 , when totality lasted as long as 2 minutes 49 seconds within a path through Washington, Montana and North Dakota in the U.S. and Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec, Canada, and Greenland.\n\n3. It will be the darkest U.S total solar eclipse for 217 years\n\nA long totality also means a darker totality, which could surprise eclipse-chasers who witnessed the early twilight-like light during totality at the last U.S. total solar eclipse on August 21, 2017. The level of darkness is a function of the magnitude of a solar eclipse — the fraction of the sun's diameter obscured by the moon , affecting the width of the path of totality. In 2017, the magnitude was 1.03 and the path of totality was about 70 miles wide. The sky darkened enough to reveal Venus. On April 8, the magnitude will 1.05 and the path of totality about 115 miles wide, revealing Jupiter as well as Venus .\n\n4. A comet may be visible during totality\n\n(Left) The SOHO observatory spotted comet C/2020 X3, seen in the bottom left-hand corner. (Right) A composite image shows the sun's corona as seen during the total solar eclipse on December 14, 2020. (Image credit: ESA/NASA/SOHO/Andreas Möller/Arbeitskreis Meteore e.V./Jay Pasachoff/Roman Vanur/Joy Ng)\n\nIt is something of a long shot, but a comet may be visible during totality on April 8. Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks — also known as the \"Devil Comet\" — will be about 25 degrees from the sun, relatively close to Jupiter .\n\nWhile Jupiter should be visible during totality to the naked eye totality, the comet could reach magnitude +4.7, putting it on the cusp of naked eye visibility. So it's probable that the comet won't be easily seen — unless it has an outburst, something it has done before .\n\nIf you plan to observe totality through binoculars, it may be worth a quick scan to look for it, though it's more likely to show up on long-exposure images. Bright \"eclipse comets\" are very rare, with images more likely to reveal them if they're around. That last happened during the total solar eclipse in Chile and Argentina on December 14, 2020, when Comet C/2020 X3 (SOHO) was detected during totality .\n\n5. It will be the most-watched total solar eclipse ever in North America\n\nAbout 31 million people in the U.S. live inside the path of totality, which will go through parts of 15 U.S. states, according to GreatAmericanEclipse.com . Add northern Mexico and Canada, and it's around 40 million. That compares to about 12 million for the 2017 total solar eclipse.\n\n6. This total solar eclipse will be one of the most urban\n\nAbout a quarter of everyone who experiences totality on April 8 will do so from a city. Huge cities in the path of totality include Mazatlán and Torreón in Mexico, Dallas-ForthWorth-Arlington, Austin and (parts of) San Antonio in Texas, Little Rock, Indianapolis, Cleveland, Buffalo, Rochester, and Hamilton, Niagara, St. Catharines, Kingston and Montreal in Canada. That's about 10 million people.\n\nThere are many other reasons why the total solar eclipse on April 8 will be unique. The last total solar eclipse in North America until one in Alaska on March 30, 2033 , it will be the longest totality (peaking at 4 minutes 28 seconds in Nazas, Mexico) observed on land since a 4 minutes 40 seconds totality on Rapa Nui/Easter Island on July 11, 2010. It also crosses the path of the 2017 total solar eclipse, with Southern Illinois and Missouri experiencing totality for the second time in less than seven years.\n\nKeep up to date with the latest eclipse content on our eclipse live blog and watch all the total eclipse action unfold live here on Space.com.",

It was promoted to Bostonians by the book <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Darkness_at_Noon_or_the_Great_solar_ecli/c63fMgEACAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;printsec=frontcover\">Darkness At Noon</a>. That event is also known as Tecumseh's Eclipse. <a href=\"https://www.eclipse-chasers.com/article/history/tse1806.html\">According to</a> eclipse-chaser Bill Kramer, two leaders of the Shawnee people predicted the eclipse and witnessed it from Greenville, Ohio &#8212; which on April 8 will experience totality for 3 minutes 55 seconds.

During solar minimum &#8212; when our star's magnetic activity is at its lowest in its roughly 11-year cycle &#8212; it has an asymmetrical, thorny look, as it did during the last total solar eclipse in North America on August 21, 2017. That will not be the case on April 8, when the sun's corona will seem larger, more symmetrical and sunflower-like. It's a consequence of magnetic activity in <a href=\"https://www.space.com/58-the-sun-formation-facts-and-characteristics.html\">the sun</a>, and sometime this year, the sun is <a href=\"https://www.space.com/solar-maximum-expected-2024-new-predictions-suggest\">predicted to reach solar maximum</a>.&#160;</p><p>The last time a total solar eclipse visible from North America coincided with solar maximum was on <a href=\"http://xjubier.free.fr/en/site_pages/solar_eclipses/TSE_1979_GoogleMapFull.html\">February 26, 1979</a>, when totality lasted as long as 2 minutes 49 seconds within a path through Washington, Montana and North Dakota in the U.S. and Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec, Canada, and Greenland.&#160;</p><h2 id=\"3-it-will-be-the-darkest-u-s-total-solar-eclipse-for-217-years-xa0-3\">3. It will be the darkest U.S total solar eclipse for 217 years&#160;</h2><p>A long totality also means a darker totality, which could surprise eclipse-chasers who witnessed the early twilight-like light during totality at the last U.S. total solar eclipse on August 21, 2017. The level of darkness is a function of the magnitude of a solar eclipse &#8212; the fraction of the sun's diameter obscured by <a href=\"https://www.space.com/55-earths-moon-formation-composition-and-orbit.html\">the moon</a>, affecting the width of the path of totality. In 2017, the <a href=\"https://www.space.com/21640-star-luminosity-and-magnitude.html\">magnitude</a> was 1.03 and the path of totality was about 70 miles wide. The sky darkened enough to reveal Venus. On April 8, the magnitude will 1.05 and the path of totality about 115 miles wide, revealing Jupiter as well as <a href=\"https://www.space.com/44-venus-second-planet-from-the-sun-brightest-planet-in-solar-system.html\">Venus</a>. &#160;</p><h2 id=\"4-a-comet-may-be-visible-during-totality-3\">4.

Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks &#8212; also known as the \"Devil Comet\" &#8212; will be about 25 degrees from the sun, relatively close to <a href=\"https://www.space.com/7-jupiter-largest-planet-solar-system.html\">Jupiter</a>.</p><p>While Jupiter should be visible during totality to the naked eye totality, the comet could reach magnitude +4.7, putting it on the cusp of naked eye visibility. So it's probable that the comet won't be easily seen &#8212; unless it has an outburst, something <a href=\"https://www.space.com/devil-comet-12p-pons-brooks-approaching-earth\">it has done before</a>.&#160;</p><p>If you plan to observe totality through binoculars, it may be worth a quick scan to look for it, though it's more likely to show up on long-exposure images. Bright \"eclipse comets\" are very rare, with images more likely to reveal them if they're around. That last happened during the total solar eclipse in Chile and Argentina on December 14, 2020, when <a href=\"https://www.space.com/new-comet-seen-during-2020-solar-eclipse\">Comet C/2020 X3 (SOHO) was detected during totality</a>. &#160;</p><h2 id=\"5-it-will-be-the-most-watched-total-solar-eclipse-ever-in-north-america-xa0-3\">5. It will be the most-watched total solar eclipse ever in North America&#160;</h2><p>About 31 million people in the U.S. live inside the path of totality, which will go through parts of 15 U.S. states, according to <a href=\"http://greatamericaneclipse.com/\" target=\"_blank\">GreatAmericanEclipse.com</a>. Add northern Mexico and Canada, and it's around 40 million. That compares to about 12 million for the 2017 total solar eclipse.&#160;</p><h2 id=\"6-this-total-solar-eclipse-will-be-one-of-the-most-urban-xa0-3\">6. This total solar eclipse will be one of the most urban&#160;</h2><p>About a quarter of everyone who experiences totality on April 8 will do so from a city. Huge cities in the path of totality include Mazatl&#225;n and Torre&#243;n in Mexico, Dallas-ForthWorth-Arlington, Austin and (parts of) San Antonio in Texas, Little Rock, Indianapolis, Cleveland, Buffalo, Rochester, and Hamilton, Niagara, St. Catharines, Kingston and Montreal in Canada. That's about 10 million people.&#160;</p><p>There are many other reasons why the total solar eclipse on April 8 will be unique. The last total solar eclipse in North America until one in Alaska on <a href=\"http://xjubier.free.fr/en/site_pages/solar_eclipses/TSE_2033_GoogleMapFull.html\">March 30, 2033</a>, it will be the longest totality (peaking at 4 minutes 28 seconds in Nazas, Mexico) observed on land since a 4 minutes 40 seconds totality on Rapa Nui/Easter Island on July 11, 2010.

This eclipse coincides with solar maximum, resulting in a larger and more symmetrical solar corona. The magnitude of the eclipse will result in the darkest totality experienced in the U.S. in 217 years, potentially revealing Jupiter and Venus in the sky. Additionally, there is a slim chance of witnessing a comet during totality, and the event is set to become the most-watched total solar eclipse in North America due to its visibility from densely populated urban areas, attracting approximately 40 million people across Mexico, the U.S., and Canada."

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nWhen a total solar eclipse creates a spectacle in the skies over Mexico and North America on April 8, it will mark the first time such an event has occurred in this part of the world for nearly seven years — and the last time one will until 2044.\n\nTotal solar eclipses happen when the moon passes between Earth and the sun, completely blocking the sun’s face. But these celestial events aren’t all exactly alike.\n\nWhile April’s eclipse has a path similar to the one that occurred on August 21, 2017, albeit moving in the opposite direction and covering more ground, there are quite a few differences between the two that make 2024’s occurrence one to anticipate, according to NASA. One key factor that sets this year’s event apart is who will be able to see it.\n\nNASA estimates that 215 million adults across the US saw the 2017 eclipse directly or virtually.\n\n“This year’s total solar eclipse will be at least partially visible to all in the contiguous United States, making it the most accessible eclipse this nation has experienced in this generation,” said Nicola Fox, associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, in a statement.\n\nA longer, more visible eclipse\n\nMore people will be able to see the 2024 eclipse because the path of totality, or locations where people will witness the moon’s shadow completely covering the sun, will be wider. The moon’s distance from Earth varies as it orbits our planet, and during the 2017 total solar eclipse, the moon was farther away from Earth and caused the area of totality to be narrower, extending from about 62 to 71 miles (100 to 114 kilometers) wide.\n\nBut the moon will be closer to our planet during this year’s event, so the path its shadow will follow over North America is expected to stretch about 108 to 122 miles (174 to 196 kilometers) wide.\n\nThe path of the 2024 eclipse also passes over more densely populated areas and major cities than before. Only 12 million people lived within the area of totality for the 2017 eclipse, while nearly 32 million are in the 2024 path, and 150 million people live within 200 miles (322 kilometers) of it.\n\nThis composite image shows the progression of a partial solar eclipse over Ross Lake in Northern Cascades National Park in Washington on August 21, 2017. Bill Ingalls/NASA\n\nPeople outside the path of totality will still be able to see a partial solar eclipse, where the moon only blocks part of the sun’s face. A whopping 99% of those living across the US, including parts of Hawaii and Alaska, will be able to glimpse at least a partial solar eclipse without having to travel.\n\nApril’s eclipse will also have longer period of totality than 2017 because of the moon’s proximity to Earth. Totality is one of the shortest phases of an eclipse, and its duration is dependent on viewing location. Observers closest to the center of the path will experience the longest totality, and the length of that window decreases closer to the path’s edge.\n\nIn 2017, skygazers glimpsing the longest totality experienced it for two minutes and 42 seconds near Carbondale, Illinois.\n\nThis year, an area about 25 minutes northwest of Torreón, Mexico, will offer the longest totality at four minutes and 28 seconds, but people across Texas and even as far north as Economy, Indiana, will see totality that lasts longer than four minutes. And when the eclipse crosses into Canada, viewers can still expect to see totality for 3 minutes and 21 seconds.\n\nThe longest period of totality in recent history was seven minutes and 8 seconds, and it occurred west of the Philippines on June 20, 1955, according to the Guinness Book of World Records.\n\nWant to know what you’ll see during the eclipse? Use our interactive map to determine where you’ll be in the path. And don’t forget to grab a pair of eclipse glasses to safely watch the event.\n\nThe great solar experiment\n\nWhile the eclipse is a treat for sky-gazers, the event also offers scientists an opportunity to study the sun in unique ways. And April’s eclipse will allow scientists a special glimpse of the sun during one of its most active periods, called solar maximum.\n\nThe sun experiences a regular 11-year cycle of waxing and waning activity tied to when the star’s magnetic field flips. The 2017 eclipse occurred as the sun neared solar minimum, when the star experiences less activity.\n\nExperts have predicted that solar maximum, the peak of solar magnetic field activity, will occur later this year. Scientists anticipate that exciting features resembling loops, streamers and bright curls will be visible in the sun’s hot outer atmosphere, known as the corona, when the moon blocks the star’s surface from view during the upcoming eclipse. The corona, which is fainter than the surface of the sun, is easier to see during an eclipse, allowing scientists to study it in greater detail.\n\nIt’s also possible that an eruption of material from the sun’s surface, called a coronal mass ejection, might be visible during the eclipse.\n\nSeveral experiments will fly aboard NASA’s WB-57 high-altitude research aircraft during the eclipse to study the corona with the hopes of capturing new details about its structure across different wavelengths of light.",

Dubbed the 2024 Great North American Solar Eclipse, it’s the first to appear across the United States since 2017, and according to NASA, the next total solar eclipse visible from the contiguous United States won’t happen again until 2044.\n\nGet The Big To-Do Your guide to staying entertained, from live shows and outdoor fun to the newest in museums, movies, TV, books, dining, and more.

(To find a location in New England where you can observe the total solar eclipse, visit NASA’s website here.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It’s a huge deal and those of us in the contiguous United States have a front-row seat,” says Titi Shodiya, executive producer and host of the Dope Labs podcast. Dope Labs is a science and pop culture podcast created and hosted by scientists (and friends) Shodiya and Zakiya Whatley.\n\nThe Museum of Science, Boston and Dope Labs have launched a six-episode podcast series on the upcoming solar eclipse, explaining how it happens, fun space facts, the path of totality crossing through New England, and safety tips for viewing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The eclipse is going to be beautiful,” says Whatley. “If you are close and can get to the path — known as the path of totality when there will be a complete eclipse of the sun — you should definitely see it!”\n\nThough totality lasts a few minutes, the spectacle can take up to two and a half hours, as the moon, visible as a black disk, slowly passes in front of the sun.\n\n“If you are in the path of totality or a place where a majority of the sun is covered, it’ll get darker and darker outside and feel cooler,” says Shodiya. “You may see animals and your pets behaving a little differently. Some people say experiencing a total solar eclipse can feel a little eerie in the time leading up to totality.”\n\nKids learn about the sun at the Museum of Science, Boston, in advance of the total solar eclipse that will happen on April 8.

Do not look directly at the sun without specialized eye protection for solar viewing. You need specialized eclipse glasses that are thousands of times darker than regular sunglasses.\n\n“The most important thing to remember when purchasing eclipse glasses or handheld viewers is to make sure that they comply with the ISO 12312-2 international safety standard, and that they come from a reputable supplier. A great place to purchase is the Museum of Science at mos.org/eclipse,” says Whatley.\n\nDuring the eclipse, look for a bright flash right before the moon totally covers the sun, and for the sun’s corona during totality. The corona, the fiery outermost layer of the sun’s atmosphere, is usually hidden by the sun’s bright surface, but can be viewed during a total solar eclipse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPreparation for the cosmic event is in full swing throughout New England, with many special events in the works, including star parties, carnivals, concerts, and more, to be held at state and local parks, ski resorts, campgrounds, museums, hotels, and resorts. Many Northern New England places, typically closed in spring, are planning early openings to celebrate the event, and lodging near the path of totality is selling out fast. If your heart is set on viewing totality, make plans now to head north to Vermont, New Hampshire, or Maine, where the best viewing will take place.\n\nPath of totality during the April 8 solar eclipse. NASA\n\nVermont\n\nMuch of northwestern Vermont and the Northeast Kingdom will be in the path of totality, including Burlington, Montpelier, Middlebury, Newport, and St. Johnsbury. Many in the area can experience up to three and a half minutes of complete or partial darkness between 3:20 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. Several communities and businesses are planning events. For example, the Fairbanks Museum in St. Johnsbury is hosting Sun+Moon+YOU, a day of programming including live coverage with But Why: A Podcast for Curious Kids host and executive producer Jane Lindholm and astronomy expert Mark Breen. At Jay Peak ski resort, the lifts will stop at 2 p.m. and the band Pink Talking Fish will play Pink Floyd’s “The Dark Side of the Moon” as the eclipse reaches totality. You can watch the eclipse on the airfield at the Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport, with live music, food, and drinks.

Much of the path of totality in the Granite State will occur in the Great North Woods, from about the city of Lancaster north to the Canadian border. But the entire state will experience about 95 percent coverage. Special events include the Total Eclipse of The Parks at the Lodges at Coleman State Park, which will open to the public early for the day’s viewing, a series of events at Appalachian Mountain Club Highland Center at Crawford Notch and Joe Dodge Lodge at Pinkham Notch, including guided hikes, night sky tours, naturalist programs, cosmic crafts, and live streams from NASA.

The path exits the United States in Houlton, Maine, with the state’s longest duration of darkness, a full 3:19 minutes. If you haven’t yet booked your lodging near Houlton, you better hurry, as hotels in the area are nearing capacity.

                        "publisher": "The Atlantic",
                        "newstext": "On June 3, 2021, a roughly 60-year-old man in the riverside city of Magdeburg, Germany, received his first COVID vaccine. He opted for Johnson & Johnson’s shot, popular at that point because unlike Pfizer’s and Moderna’s vaccines, it was one-and-done. But that, evidently, was not what he had in mind. The following month, he got the AstraZeneca vaccine. The month after that, he doubled up on AstraZeneca and added a Pfizer for good measure. Things only accelerated from there: In January 2022, he received at least 49 COVID shots.\n\nA few months later, employees at a local vaccination center thought to themselves, Huh, wasn’t that guy in here yesterday? and alerted the police. By that point, the German Press Agency reported, the man had been vaccinated as many as 90 times. And still he was not done. As of November, he said he’d received 217 COVID shots—217!\n\nThat’s according to a new paper published in The Lancet. After German researchers learned of the man from newspaper articles, they managed to contact him via the public prosecutor investigating the case. He was “very interested” in participating in a study Kilian Schober, an immunologist at Uniklinikum Erlangen and a co-author on the paper said in a statement. They pieced together his vaccination timeline through interviews and medical records, and collected blood and saliva samples to examine the immunological effects of “hypervaccination.”\n\nThe man’s identity hasn’t been revealed, and in the paper he’s referred to only as “HIM” (seemingly an acronym, though what it stands for is not specified). He is hardly the world’s only hypervaccinated person. A retired postman in India had reportedly received 12 shots by January 2022 and told The New York Times, “I still want more.” A New Zealand man, meanwhile, allegedly racked up 10 in a single day. But pause for a moment and consider the sheer logistics of HIM’s feat. In all, he received his 217 vaccinations over the course of just under two and a half years, which comes out to an average of seven and a half shots a month, although the distribution was far from even. For several weeks in early 2022, he received two shots nearly every day. He seems to have had a strong preference for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, but he also got at least one shot of AstraZeneca and Sanofi-GSK and, of course, Johnson & Johnson.\n\nWhy? you might wonder. The paper itself elides this question, saying only that he did so “deliberately and for private reasons.” Perhaps the most obvious explanation would be extreme, probably pathological COVID anxiety. News reports from April 2022 offer another possible explanation: that he did so to sell the vaccination cards. But German prosecutors did not bring charges once HIM’s scheme was uncovered, and he continued getting unnecessary shots.\n\nGetting 217 COVID shots is very much not the public-health guidance in Germany or anywhere else. Yet the strategy seemingly panned out: HIM has never contracted COVID, researchers concluded based on antigen tests, PCR tests, and bloodwork. “If you ask immunologists, we might have predicted that it would be not beneficial to do this,” Cindy Leifer, an immunologist at Cornell University who wasn’t involved with the Lancet study, told me. They might have expected the constant action to exhaust the immune system, leaving it vulnerable to actual viral threats. But such worries came to nothing.\n\nStill, immunologists cautioned against inferring any strong causal connection. He avoided the virus; he got vaccinated 217 times. He did not necessarily avoid the virus because he got vaccinated 217 times. In fact, the authors wrote, although hypervaccination seems to have increased the quantity of antibodies and T cells that HIM’s body produced to fend off the virus—even after 216 shots, the 217th still produced a modest increase—it had no real effect on the quality of the immune response. “He would have been just as well protected if he had gotten a normal number of three to four vaccinations,” Schober told me.\n\nNor did hypervaccination lead to any adverse effects. By shot 217, one might have expected to see some of the rare side effects associated with the vaccines, such as myocarditis, pericarditis, or Guillain-Barré Syndrome, but as far as researchers could tell, HIM was completely fine. Remarkably, he didn’t even report feeling minor side effects from any of his 217 shots. On some level, this makes total sense: As Schober reasonably pointed out, HIM probably would not have gotten all those shots if each one had knocked him out for a day. Fair, but still: 217 shots and no side effects? How?\n\nIf nothing else, HIM is one hell of an advertisement for the vaccines. Worried about side effects from your third booster? Well, this guy’s gotten more than 200, and he’s a-okay. Travis Kelce has been called Mr. Pfizer, but he’s got nothing on HIM. Scientifically, things are somewhat murkier. The results of the HIM study were largely unsurprising, researchers told me, but the mysteries at the margins—such as the absence of any side effects—are a good reminder that four years after the pandemic began, immunology is still, as my former colleague Ed Yong wrote, “where intuition goes to die.”\n\nAt the end of the paper, the authors are very clear: “We do not endorse hypervaccination as a strategy to enhance adaptive immunity.” The takeaway, Leifer said, should not be the more shots, the better. Schober told me he even tried to personally convey this message to HIM after his 216th shot. “From the bottom of my heart as a medical doctor, I really told him that he shouldn’t get vaccinated again,” Schober said.\n\nHIM seemed to take this advice seriously. Then he went and got shot No. 217 anyway.",

He seems to have had a strong preference for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, but he also got at least one shot of AstraZeneca and Sanofi-GSK and, of course, Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\"></p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">Why? you might wonder. The paper itself elides this question, saying only that he did so &#8220;deliberately and for private reasons.&#8221; Perhaps the most obvious explanation would be extreme, probably pathological COVID anxiety. News reports from April 2022 offer another possible explanation: that he did so to sell the vaccination cards. But German prosecutors did not bring charges once HIM&#8217;s scheme was uncovered, and he continued getting unnecessary shots.</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\"></p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">Getting 217 COVID shots is very much not the public-health guidance in Germany or anywhere else. Yet the strategy seemingly panned out: HIM has never contracted COVID, researchers concluded based on antigen tests, PCR tests, and bloodwork. &#8220;If you ask immunologists, we might have predicted that it would be not beneficial to do this,&#8221; Cindy Leifer, an immunologist at Cornell University who wasn&#8217;t involved with the Lancet study, told me. They might have expected the constant action to exhaust the immune system, leaving it vulnerable to actual viral threats. But such worries came to nothing.</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\"></p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">Still, immunologists cautioned against inferring any strong causal connection. He avoided the virus; he got vaccinated 217 times. He did not necessarily avoid the virus because he got vaccinated 217 times. In fact, the authors wrote, although hypervaccination seems to have increased the quantity of antibodies and T cells that HIM&#8217;s body produced to fend off the virus&#8212;even after 216 shots, the 217th still produced a modest increase&#8212;it had no real effect on the quality of the immune response. &#8220;He would have been just as well protected if he had gotten a normal number of three to four vaccinations,&#8221; Schober told me.</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\"></p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">Nor did hypervaccination lead to any adverse effects. By shot 217, one might have expected to see some of the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html\">rare side effects</a> associated with the vaccines, such as myocarditis, pericarditis, or Guillain-Barr&#233; Syndrome, but as far as researchers could tell, HIM was completely fine. Remarkably, he didn&#8217;t even report feeling minor side effects from any of his 217 shots. On some level, this makes total sense: As Schober reasonably pointed out, HIM probably would not have gotten all those shots if each one had knocked him out for a day. Fair, but still: 217 shots and no side effects? How?</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\"></p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">If nothing else, HIM is one hell of an advertisement for the vaccines. Worried about side effects from your third booster? Well, this guy&#8217;s gotten more than 200, and he&#8217;s a-okay. Travis Kelce has been <a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/travis-kelce-responds-to-mr-pfizer-label-from-aaron-rodgers\">called</a> Mr. Pfizer, but he&#8217;s got nothing on HIM. Scientifically, things are somewhat murkier. The results of the HIM study were largely unsurprising, researchers told me, but the mysteries at the margins&#8212;such as the absence of any side effects&#8212;are a good reminder that four years after the pandemic began, immunology is still, as my former colleague Ed Yong wrote, &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/08/covid-19-immunity-is-the-pandemics-central-mystery/614956/\">where intuition goes to die</a>.&#8221;</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\"></p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">At the end of the paper, the authors are very clear: &#8220;We do not endorse hypervaccination as a strategy to enhance adaptive immunity.&#8221; The takeaway, Leifer said, should not be the more shots, the better. Schober told me he even tried to personally convey this message to HIM after his 216th shot. &#8220;From the bottom of my heart as a medical doctor, I really told him that he shouldn&#8217;t get vaccinated again,&#8221; Schober said.</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\"></p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">HIM seemed to take this advice seriously. Then he went and got shot No. 217 anyway.</p><p class=\"ArticleBody_divider__GpNxD\" id=\"article-end\"></p></div>",

                "newstext": "CNN —\n\nSign up for CNN’s Life, But Greener newsletter. Our limited newsletter series guides you on how to minimize your personal role in the climate crisis — and reduce your eco-anxiety.\n\nPeople with microplastics or nanoplastics in their carotid artery tissues were twice as likely to have a heart attack, stroke or die from any cause over the next three years than people who had none, a new study found.\n\nCarotid arteries, which lie on each side of the neck and carry blood to the brain, can become clogged with fatty cholesterol plaques in a similar fashion as the arteries leading into the heart, a process known as atherosclerosis.\n\n“To date, our study is the first that associated the plastic contamination with human diseases,” said Raffaele Marfella, lead author of the study published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\n“Our data must be confirmed by other studies and on larger populations,” said Marfella, professor of internal medicine and director of the department of medical and surgical sciences at the University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli in Naples, Italy, in an email. “However, our study convincingly highlights the presence of plastics and their association with cardiovascular events in a representative population affected by atherosclerosis.”\n\nPediatrician Dr. Philip Landrigan, professor of biology at Boston College and director of the Program for Global Public Health and the Common Good and the Global Observatory on Planetary Health, said the study provided evidence that tiny plastics may be associated with cardiovascular disease outcomes in humans.\n\n“Although we do not know what other exposures may have contributed to the adverse outcomes among patients in this study, the finding of microplastics and nanoplastics in plaque tissue is itself a breakthrough discovery that raises a series of urgent questions,” Landrigan wrote in an accompanying editorial.\n\n“Should exposure to microplastics and nanoplastics be considered a cardiovascular risk factor? What organs in addition to the heart may be at risk? How can we reduce exposure?” asked Landrigan, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nNanoplastics appear as bright red dots in an electron microscope. Mary Conlon/AP\n\n“What is widely known is that many plastics from bicycle helmets and blood bags to drinking water pipes and wind turbines help protect us, improve healthcare outcomes, and contribute to a more sustainable world,” said Kimberly Wise White, vice president of regulatory and scientific affairs for the American Chemistry Council, an industry association.\n\n“To help reduce new sources of microplastic in our environment, plastic makers have a goal for all US plastic packaging to be reused, recycled, or recovered by 2040. To get there, we’re investing billions of dollars in infrastructure improvements and advocating for effective policies to help collect and recycle more used plastics to keep them from entering our environment in the first place,” Wise White said in an email.\n\nDangers of tiny plastic particles\n\nMicroplastics are polymer fragments that can range from less than 0.2 inch (5 millimeters) down to 1/25,000th of an inch (1 micrometer). Anything smaller is a nanoplastic that must be measured in billionths of a meter.\n\nNanoplastics are the most worrisome plastics for human health, experts say. At 1,000th the average width of a human hair, the minuscule bits can migrate through the tissues of the digestive tract or lungs into the bloodstream.\n\nFrom there, nanoplastics can invade individual cells and tissues in major organs, potentially interrupting cellular processes and depositing endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as bisphenols, phthalates, flame retardants, heavy metals and per- and polyfluorinated substances, or PFAS.\n\nIn studies of pregnant mice, researchers have found plastic chemicals in the brain, heart, liver, kidney and lungs of the developing fetus 24 hours after the pregnant mother ingested or breathed in plastic particles. Other research has shown that micro- and nanoplastics may cause oxidative stress, tissue damage and inflammation in cells, while animal studies have shown such particles may alter heart rate and impede cardiac function.\n\nNanoplastics have been found in human blood, lung and liver tissues, urine and feces, mother’s milk, and the placenta. Until now, however, research has yet to determine just what impact those polymers may have on the body’s organs and functions.\n\n“There currently is no scientific consensus on the potential health impacts of nano- and microplastic particles. Therefore, media reports based on assumptions and conjecture do nothing more than unnecessarily scare the public,” said a spokesperson for the International Bottled Water Association, an industry association, in an email.\n\nA recent study found 1 liter of bottled water — the equivalent of two standard-size bottled waters typically purchased by consumers — contained an average of 240,000 plastic particles from seven types of plastics — 90% were nanoplastics.\n\n“It is important to note that bottled water is just one of thousands of food and beverage products packaged in plastic containers,” the spokesperson said. “The largest sources of microplastics in the environment are from erosion and abrasion of synthetic rubber tires, synthetic textiles (e.g., washing clothes made of polyester), and the breakdown of city and household waste.”\n\nA unique study approach\n\nThe new study examined tissue removed from the neck arteries of 257 people who underwent carotid endarterectomy.\n\n“It’s kind of a barbaric procedure. Surgeons open up the carotid artery and literally dissect all of the sludge, the plaque, that’s built up in there,” said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. He was not involved in the research.\n\nHaving access to such tissue allowed researchers to use an electron microscope to look for minute particles. The examination found “visible, jagged-edged foreign particles” scattered in the plaque and external debris from the surgery, the study said.\n\nMeasurable amounts of polyethylene, a common plastic used in plastic wrap, plastic bags, and food and drink containers, were found in the plaque tissues of 150 people in the study.\n\nSome samples also contained chlorine, used to treat swimming pool water and in the production of hundreds of consumer products such as paper, paints, textiles and insecticides. Samples from another 31 patients also had measurable amounts of polyvinyl chloride, also known as PVC or vinyl.\n\nParticipants with microplastics and nanoplastics in their bodies were followed for 34 months. In addition to being twice as likely to have a heart attack or stroke or die early from any cause, the plaque tissue showed signs of increased inflammation, said Phoebe Stapleton, associate professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Rutgers University’s Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy in Piscataway, New Jersey. She was not involved in the new study.\n\n“Low-grade inflammation is related to a number of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease. Presence of microplastics and nanoplastics, and subsequent inflammation, may act to increase one’s susceptibility to these chronic diseases,” Stapleton said in an email.\n\nHowever, calling the study results “a direct link to cardiovascular disease is a stretch for the findings,” she added. “I think that with more work, we may find these exposures to be a risk factor … more particles, more inflammation, more risk for poor cardiovascular outcomes.”\n\nrecent study found the equivalent of two standard-size bottled waters contained an average of 240,000 plastic particles — 90% were nanoplastics. mediaphotos/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nLimiting exposure to plastic\n\nAvoiding plastic contamination is “challenging, if not impossible,” yet “each of us, in our small way could start using less plastic and direct our daily choices towards other materials,”\n\nThere are additional steps one can take to reduce exposure to phthalates and other chemicals in food and food packaging products, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics’ policy statement on food additives and children’s health.\n\n“One is to reduce our plastic footprint by using stainless steel and glass containers, when possible,” said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, director of environmental pediatrics at NYU Langone Health, in a prior interview with CNN.\n\n“Avoid microwaving food or beverages in plastic, including infant formula and pumped human milk, and don’t put plastic in the dishwasher, because the heat can cause chemicals to leach out,” said Trasande, who is also the lead author for the American Academy of Pediatrics’ policy statement on food additives and children’s health .\n\n“Look at the recycling code on the bottom of products to find the plastic type, and avoid plastics with recycling codes 3, which typically contain phthalates,” he added. Phthalates, known as “everywhere chemicals” because they are so common, are one of the chemicals used in manufacturing known to be hormone disruptors.\n\nCut down on the use of disposable plastics, suggests the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group. Other suggestions include bringing reusable bags to the grocery store. Invest in a zippered fabric bag and ask the dry cleaner to return your clothes in that instead of those thin sheets of plastic. Bring a travel mug to the local coffee store for takeout and silverware to the office, cutting back on plastic cups and utensils.",

And they shed microscopic particles that end up in the environment and can be ingested or inhaled by people.\n\nNow the first data of their kind show a link between these microplastics and human health. A study of more than 200 people undergoing surgery found that nearly 60% had microplastics or even smaller nanoplastics in a main artery1. Those who did were 4.5 times more likely to experience a heart attack, a stroke or death in the approximately 34 months after the surgery than were those whose arteries were plastic-free.\n\n“This is a landmark trial,” says Robert Brook, a physician-scientist at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, who studies the environmental effects on cardiovascular health and was not involved with the study. “This will be the launching pad for further studies across the world to corroborate, extend and delve into the degree of the risk that micro- and nanoplastics pose.”\n\nBut Brook, other researchers and the authors themselves caution that this study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine on 6 March, does not show that the tiny pieces caused poor health. Other factors that the researchers did not study, such as socio-economic status, could be driving ill health rather than the plastics themselves, they say.\n\nPlastic planet\n\nScientists have found microplastics just about everywhere they’ve looked: in oceans; in shellfish; in breast milk; in drinking water; wafting in the air; and falling with rain.\n\nSuch contaminants are not only ubiquitous but also long-lasting, often requiring centuries to break down. As a result, cells responsible for removing waste products can’t readily degrade them, so microplastics accumulate in organisms.\n\nMicroplastics are everywhere — but are they harmful?\n\nIn humans, they have been found in the blood and in organs such as the lungs and placenta. However, just because they accumulate doesn’t mean they cause harm. Scientists have been worried about the health effects of microplastics for around 20 years, but what those effects are has proved difficult to evaluate rigorously, says Philip Landrigan, a paediatrician and epidemiologist at Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts.\n\nGiuseppe Paolisso, an internal-medicine physician at the University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli in Caserta, Italy, and his colleagues knew that microplastics are attracted to fat molecules, so they were curious about whether the particles would build up in fatty deposits called plaques that can form on the lining of blood vessels. The team tracked 257 people undergoing a surgical procedure that reduces stroke risk by removing plaque from an artery in the neck.\n\nBlood record\n\nThe researchers put the excised plaques under an electron microscope. They saw jagged blobs — evidence of microplastics — intermingled with cells and other waste products in samples from 150 of the participants. Chemical analyses revealed that the bulk of the particles were composed of either polyethylene, which is the most used plastic in the world and is often found in food packaging, shopping bags and medical tubing, or polyvinyl chloride, known more commonly as PVC or vinyl.\n\nMicroplastic particles (arrows) infiltrate a living immune cell called a macrophage that was removed from a fatty deposit in a study participant’s blood vessel.Credit: R. Marfella et al./N Engl J Med\n\nOn average, participants who had more microplastics in their plaque samples also had higher levels of biomarkers for inflammation, analyses revealed. That hints at how the particles could contribute to ill health, Brook says. If they help to trigger inflammation, they might boost the risk that a plaque will rupture, spilling fatty deposits that could clog blood vessels.\n\nCompared to participants who didn’t have microplastics in their plaques, participants who did were younger; more likely to be male; more likely to smoke and more likely to have diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Because the study included only people who required surgery to reduce stroke risk, it is unknown whether the link holds true in a broader population.\n\nBrook is curious about the 40% of participants who showed no evidence of microplastics in their plaques, especially given that it is nearly impossible to avoid plastics altogether. Study co-author Sanjay Rajagopalan, a cardiologist at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, says it’s possible that these participants behave differently or have different biological pathways for processing the plastics, but more research is needed.\n\nStalled progress\n\nThe study comes as diplomats try to hammer out a global treaty to eliminate plastic pollution. In 2022, 175 nations voted to create a legally binding international agreement, with a goal of finalizing it by the end of 2024.\n\nResearchers have fought for more input into the process, noting that progress on the treaty has been too slow. The latest study is likely to light a fire under negotiators when they gather in Ottawa in April, says Landrigan, who co-authored a report2 that recommended a global cap on plastic production.\n\nWhile Rajagopalan awaits further data on microplastics, his findings have already had an impact on his daily life. “I’ve had a much more conscious, intentional look at my own relationship with plastics,” he says. “I hope this study brings some introspection into how we, as a society, use petroleum-derived products to reshape the biosphere.”",

In a new study, researchers say they have for the first time detected these plastic pieces inside fatty plaques that accumulate in blood vessels and linked them to an increased rate of heart problems.\n\nResearchers found that people who had these plastic pieces in their plaques experienced a 4.5-fold greater risk of major complications including heart attacks, strokes, or death compared to those with plastic-free plaques, according to the study, published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSpecifically, over about a three-year period, 30 out of 150 — or 20% — of patients who had plastic detected in their plaques experienced a complication, compared with eight out of 107 — or 7.5% — of patients who didn’t have plastic identified.\n\nThe types of plastic they found are commonly used in everyday life: polyethylene, which is used in plastic bags and bottles, and polyvinyl chloride, which is used in pipes, insulation, and medical devices.\n\nNewsletters Sign up for Morning Rounds Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every day Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy\n\nThe authors cautioned that the study doesn’t prove the plastic pieces definitively caused a greater risk of problems, but it does find an important link between microplastics and cardiovascular complications that should be probed in future studies, they said.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe paper comes amid a greater research focus on microplastics, which have been found all across the environment, from food and water sources to the atmosphere. The issue is expected to worsen with climate change, as rising temperatures accelerate the breakdown of plastic products. Studies so far have found microplastics to be harmful in mice and have also detected them in different parts of the human body — like the placenta, liver, and lungs — but there has been less research showing how much microplastics actually affect people’s health.\n\n“There’s already a big awareness that microplastics are everywhere, in every geographic locale,” said Sanjay Rajagopalan, an author on the study and chief of cardiovascular medicine at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. What “we don’t know is do they have significant health effects and should we really worry about them? What are the long-term effects?”\n\nThe study included about 300 people in Italy who underwent carotid endarterectomies, a type of surgery to remove the buildup of fatty plaques in blood vessels. The accumulation of these plaques over time can block vessels and lead to heart attacks or strokes.\n\nThe plaques collected from the surgeries were frozen and then analyzed by the researchers. They used microscopic techniques and chemical analyses to find jagged pieces of plastic embedded in the plaques.\n\nSince previous research has suggested microplastics may increase inflammation, the researchers looked at markers of inflammation — including interleukin-18, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and TNF-α — and found that the amount of plastic pieces in plaques correlated with levels of these inflammatory markers.\n\nChangcheng Zhou, a professor at the University of California, Riverside, who wasn’t involved in the study, said a next step of this research could be to understand the mechanisms that could explain how the microplastics might increase inflammation and lead to heart problems. One avenue to investigate is whether chemicals from the plastics leached into the plaques, said Zhou, who studies the chemicals inside plastic products.\n\nThough the study is far from proving that microplastics cause heart problems, “this is a much-needed analysis,” said Tim O’Toole, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Louisville who also wasn’t involved in the study.\n\n“The problem of microplastics contamination is going to continue or get worse because of global climate change,” said O’Toole, who has been researching the effects of pollutants on heart outcomes. “The increased temperature will increase the breakdown of these contaminants, and they’ll be even more and more a problem in our water supplies, in the food chain.”",

                        "newstext": "People with microplastics and nanoplastics in plaque lining a major blood vessel in their neck may have a higher risk of heart attack, stroke or death, new research suggests.\n\nThe findings, published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, are the first time scientists have linked these tiny plastic particles, the result of degraded plastic pollution, to cardiovascular disease.\n\nMicroplastics are defined as particles smaller than 5 millimeters, and nanoplastics are far smaller — so tiny that they can be seen only with specialized microscopes. In recent years, their ubiquity has become undeniable: They have been found in fresh snowfall in Antarctica and at the depths of the Marianas Trench, as well as in human blood; breast milk; urine; and placental, lung and liver tissue.\n\nDr. Raffaele Marfella — a cardiology researcher in the University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli’s department of advanced medical and surgical sciences in Naples, Italy, and the lead author of the new study — said that he and his colleagues initiated the study to look for new risk factors for cardiovascular disease.\n\nThey knew of the enormous amount of degraded plastic pollution contaminating the planet and wondered “whether plastic, in the form of micro- or nanoplastics, could also degrade our arteries,” Marfella said in an email. People can inhale and ingest the plastic particles. The plastic can also enter the body through skin.\n\nA blue rectangular piece of microplastic on the finger of a researcher in Tacoma, Wash. (Ted S. Warren / AP file )\n\nTo study the effects, they turned to a group of patients already scheduled to undergo surgery for a condition called carotid artery stenosis, in which plaque, or fatty deposits, blocks normal blood flow. The body’s two carotid arteries supply blood to the brain, face and neck. The researchers looked at plaque removed from 257 patients and tracked the patients’ health for an average of 34 months following the surgery.\n\nThey found plastic particles — mostly nanoplastics — in the plaque of 150 patients. At follow-up, nonfatal heart attack, nonfatal stroke or death from any cause occurred in 20% of those patients and in 7.5% of the patients without detectable plastic particles.\n\nAfter adjusting for age, sex, body mass index and health conditions such as diabetes and abnormal cholesterol, the patients with detectable levels of plastics had “nearly a five times greater risk of a cardiovascular event” than the other patients, Marfella said.\n\nNumerous experimental studies on cells and in animals have shown that the presence of these plastic particles increases diseases. One study published online in February in the Journal of Hazardous Materials found microplastics, for the first time, in human arteries.\n\nPrevious studies finding the tiny particles in human tissue were “pioneering,” said Dick Vethaak, a biologist and toxicologist at Utrecht University’s Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences and coordinator of the Dutch Microplastics and Human Health Consortium, but this study “is the first of its kind.”\n\n“It is the first one that looked at a large number of donors in so much detail” and the first to follow patients for years to track their health, said Vethaak, who wasn’t involved with the new study.\n\nHowever, this kind of observational study can show only an association between the plastic particles and heart attack, stroke or death. It cannot show that they caused these cardiovascular events. For that, researchers would need to conduct a randomized, controlled trial, but it would be unethical to intentionally expose people to potential toxins.\n\nNevertheless, the study offers some hints about the relationship between the presence of micro- and nanoplastics and heart disease, said Dr. Martha Gulati, director of preventive cardiology in the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles.\n\n“We know that cardiovascular disease, particularly myocardial infarction, is usually triggered by an inflammatory response,” Gulati said, using another term for heart attack. The Italian researchers measured markers for inflammation in patients and found that those markers increased as the level of plastics in the plaque rose.\n\nStill, “is the inflammation due to the nanoplastics or something else?” Gulati asked.\n\nBecause the study was carried out in a very specific group of patients, the results cannot be applied to the broader population.

(Ted S. Warren / AP file )</p><p>To study the effects, they turned to a group of patients already scheduled to undergo surgery for a condition called carotid artery stenosis, in which <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/wegovy-heart-disease-stroke-heart-attack-obesity-study-rcna123836\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link \">plaque</a>, or fatty deposits, blocks normal blood flow. The body&#8217;s two carotid arteries supply blood to the brain, face and neck. The researchers looked at plaque removed from 257 patients and tracked the patients&#8217; health for an average of 34 months following the surgery.</p><p>They found plastic particles &#8212; mostly nanoplastics &#8212; in the plaque of 150 patients. At follow-up, nonfatal heart attack, nonfatal stroke or death from any cause occurred in 20% of those patients and in 7.5% of the patients without detectable plastic particles.</p><p>After adjusting for age, sex, body mass index and health conditions such as diabetes and abnormal cholesterol, the patients with detectable levels of plastics had &#8220;nearly a five times greater risk of a cardiovascular event&#8221; than the other patients, Marfella said.</p><p>Numerous experimental studies on cells and in animals have shown that the presence of these plastic particles increases diseases. One study published online in February in the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304389424004345\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link \">Journal of Hazardous Materials</a> found microplastics, for the first time, in human arteries.</p><p>Previous studies finding the tiny particles in human tissue were &#8220;pioneering,&#8221; said Dick Vethaak, a biologist and toxicologist at Utrecht University&#8217;s Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences and coordinator of the Dutch Microplastics and Human Health Consortium, but this study &#8220;is the first of its kind.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;It is the first one that looked at a large number of donors in so much detail&#8221; and the first to follow patients for years to track their health, said Vethaak, who wasn&#8217;t involved with the new study.</p><p>However, this kind of observational study can show only an association between the plastic particles and heart attack, stroke or death. It cannot show that they caused these cardiovascular events. For that, researchers would need to conduct a randomized, controlled trial, but it would be unethical to intentionally expose people to potential toxins.</p><p>Nevertheless, the study offers some hints about the relationship between the presence of micro- and nanoplastics and heart disease, said Dr. Martha Gulati, director of preventive cardiology in the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles.</p><p>&#8220;We know that cardiovascular disease, particularly myocardial infarction, is usually triggered by an<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/heart-health/high-levels-niacin-may-increase-heart-disease-risk-know-b-vitamin-rcna139249\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link \"> inflammatory response</a>,&#8221; Gulati said, using another term for heart attack. The Italian researchers measured markers for inflammation in patients and found that those markers increased as the level of plastics in the plaque rose.</p><p>Still, &#8220;is the inflammation due to the nanoplastics or something else?&#8221; Gulati asked.</p><p>Because the study was carried out in a very specific group of patients, the results cannot be applied to the broader population. But it could pave the way for future studies.</p><p>&#8220;This paper might provoke people to figure out if we can measure micro- and nanoplastics in the general population and then examine who goes on to develop cardiac events,&#8221; Gulati said.</p><p>Vethaak said similar studies are in the pipeline for other kinds of human tissue.</p><p>The researchers also noted the possibility that the plaque samples could have been&#160; contaminated in the lab.</p><p>&#8220;Future studies performed with the use of clean rooms, where there is no plastic in any form except the material under study, might corroborate our observations,&#8221; they wrote in the paper.</p><p>&#8220;I hope that this study, and more work that it triggers, helps us address our environment and cardiovascular health because I feel like this is something that really needs to be discussed,&#8221; Gulati said. &#8220;It gets very little attention.&#8221;</p><p>This article was originally published on <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/microplastics-nanoplastics-plaque-carotid-artery-heart-disease-rcna142067\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link \">NBCNews.com</a></p><p id=\"view-cmts-cta-0561b292-c11b-37c3-978e-d31b4ad3790b\" class=\"view-cmts-cta-wrapper\"></p></div>",

The study, involving patients undergoing carotid artery stenosis surgery, found plastic particles, primarily nanoplastics, in plaque samples from 150 patients. Those with detectable plastic particles had a five times greater risk of a cardiovascular event compared to patients without plastic particles. While the observational nature of the study cannot establish causation, it suggests an association between plastic particle exposure and cardiovascular disease."
