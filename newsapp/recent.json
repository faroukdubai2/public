Notable differences include hardware-accelerated ray tracing, AV1 decode engine, Wi-Fi 6E support, and the ability to power two external displays when closed. While the 15-inch Air offers superior sound quality with its six-speaker system, its speakers match those of the MacBook Pro 14.

Grande's vocals are quieter and the music is designed to blend into the background, prioritizing comfort and relatability over the energetic, highlight-of-the-night songs that have traditionally defined pop music. Despite the pleasant and soothing nature of the album, its focus on personal experiences and lack of energetic charge may limit its appeal to a broader audience."

With notable genre shifts, personal lyrics, and a diverse emotional spectrum, \"eternal sunshine\" showcases Grande's growth and evolution as an artist."

The documentary \"Space: The Longest Goodbye\" follows NASA psychologist Dr. Al Holland as he develops strategies to support astronauts' mental health, drawing from insights gained from astronauts' personal experiences and the International Space Station as a testing ground. The film examines the psychological risks of prolonged separation from Earth, disrupted sleep cycles, and the absence of real-time communication, highlighting the human frailties that may impact the success of future space missions."

The drug targets a hormone in the gut that suppresses appetite, and although it can cause gastrointestinal side effects, it has been shown to effectively reduce weight and improve cardiovascular outcomes in clinical trials.
