                "newstext": "A new drive by the United Nation’s World Food Programme to deliver aid to an estimated half million people at risk of famine in northern Gaza has failed amid further scenes of chaos and violence.\n\nA 14-truck convoy destined for northern Gaza was looted on Tuesday after being held at an Israeli army checkpoint for several hours, aid workers said. As the convoy turned back after the delay, it was attacked and 200 tonnes of food looted by “a large crowd of desperate people”.\n\nInsecurity, logistical bottlenecks, ongoing fighting and restrictions on movement imposed by Israel have combined to limit aid deliveries to a fraction of what is needed, aid officials said.\n\nThe WFP convoy was the first to try to reach northern Gaza since insecurity forced the agency to pause efforts on 20 February despite looming starvation, because Israeli forces had twice shot at desperate Palestinians trying to get food from WFP trucks, senior WFP officials told the Guardian earlier this week.\n\nHopes were raised last week that Hamas and Israel were close to agreeing a deal that would pause, or possibly definitively end, hostilities and so facilitate humanitarian assistance.\n\nProspects of an agreement have receded in recent days, though a Hamas delegation remains in Cairo for talks with mediators from Egypt and Qatar.\n\nEylon Levy, as Israeli government spokesperson, said on Wednesday that Israel still wanted to see a temporary pause for humanitarian purposes that would allow the release of about 130 hostages still held by Hamas.\n\n“We will do everything we can to get them out … [But] this war will end ultimately with the total defeat of Hamas or its surrender,” Levy told reporters.\n\nThe war was triggered in October by bloody attacks into southern Israel launched by Hamas. The militant organisation, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, killed 1,200 Israelis, mainly civilians, and abducted another 250 in the surprise operation.\n\nHealth officials in Gaza said the number of people confirmed killed in Israel’s offensive had now passed 30,700, with 86 deaths reported in the past 24 hours. Most of the victims are women and children, the officials said.\n\nIsrael has accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields in Gaza and says its forces are acting entirely lawfully.\n\nShaban Abdel-Raouf, a Palestinian electrician and father of five from Gaza City, said: “Every day costs us dozens of martyrs. We want a ceasefire now,.”\n\nHe is now in the southern city of Khan Younis, where fighting is continuing. Residents reported hearing explosions all through Tuesday night and into Wednesday morning. Israeli warplanes struck areas of Al-Nuseirat refugee camp and Deir al-Balah city in central Gaza, and part of the southern city of Rafah, witnesses said.\n\nJordanian and American planes have repeatedly airdropped food in recent days but humanitarian organisation say only delivery by road will allow sufficient quantities to reach the needy and without any distribution mechanism.\n\n“Airdrops are a last resort and will not avert famine”, World Food Programme deputy directory Carl Skau said.\n\nGaza’s health ministry reported on Wednesday that a 15-year-old girl became the latest child to die from malnutrition or dehydration, at Shifa hospital in Gaza City.\n\nThe UN said in February that more than a quarter of Gaza’s 2.3 million people were “estimated to be facing catastrophic levels of deprivation and starvation”. It said without action widespread famine could be “almost inevitable”.\n\nAid can currently be delivered into southern Gaza via the Rafah crossing from Egypt and Kerem Shalom crossing from Israel.\n\nThe UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA has said that during February an average of nearly 97 trucks were able to enter Gaza each day, compared with about 150 trucks a day in January – well below a target of 500 trucks a day.\n\nThe UN has described aid access as “unpredictable and insufficient”, blaming military operations, insecurity and extensive restrictions to delivery of essential supplies.\n\nEven when aid enters Gaza, all cargos have to be unloaded from Egyptian trucks and onto local transport. There is now an acute shortage of both suitable vehicles and fuel in Gaza, which is causing further problems. Other challenges include patchy communications, limited electricity, crowds of refugees and roads strewn with rubble.\n\nIsrael has said there is no limit on the aid for civilians and has blamed the UN for any delivery issues, saying limitations on the quantity and pace of aid are dependent on the capacity of the UN and other agencies.\n\nAid officials say the insecurity has been caused by a lack of police, who have stopped guarding convoys after being targeted by Israeli forces.\n\nIsrael say the police are part of Hamas and on Wednesday called on international aid organisations to find ways to distribute aid that does not make them “complicit with terrorists”.\n\nOn Friday, the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) delivered vaccines formula milk and other supplies to Shifa, and managed to reach other hospitals in the north of Gaza two days later.\n\nTess Ingram, a spokesperson for Unicef, told the Guardian that her colleagues had described desperation for food at the hospitals they visited and doctors described their complete inability to treat dying children.\n\n“It defies all logic that children are dying because of access restrictions, We’ve got the food they need, the treatments for malnutrition required to save lives just a few miles away yet we cannot get it to them. This is a test of the world’s conscience,” Ingram said.\n\nWashington has stepped up pressure on Israel to alleviate the suffering, a message echoed by the UK foreign secretary, David Cameron.\n\n“People are dying of hunger. People are dying of otherwise preventable disease,” Cameron told the House of Lords ahead of talks with Benny Gantz, an opposition politician who joined Israeli war cabinet shortly after the outbreak of the war.\n\nIn Beirut, Osama Hamdan, a Hamas official, said any exchange of prisoners could only take place after a ceasefire.\n\nBasem Naim, a second senior Hamas official, said Hamas had presented its own draft deal and was awaiting a response from Israel, and that “the ball now is in the Americans’ court”.\n\nA deal is being sought before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan on Sunday. Violence in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories often rises during Ramadan, as does hostility towards Israel in the Arab and Muslim world.",

                "summaryai": "Due to ongoing insecurity, violence, and logistical bottlenecks, UN efforts to deliver aid to the half million people in northern Gaza at risk of famine have been halted. A convoy of 14 trucks was looted and attacked after being delayed at an Israeli checkpoint, further limiting aid deliveries to a fraction of what is needed. Despite hopes for a ceasefire to facilitate humanitarian assistance, talks between Hamas and Israel have stalled. The UN has warned of the impending famine, with over a quarter of Gaza's population facing catastrophic deprivation and starvation. The lack of police protection and restrictions imposed by Israel have hampered aid distribution, leading to children dying from malnutrition and dehydration. The international community, including the US and UK, is pressuring Israel to ease the suffering, while Hamas insists on a ceasefire before any prisoner exchange. Prospects for an agreement remain uncertain as Ramadan approaches.",

There is now an acute shortage of both suitable vehicles and fuel in Gaza, which is causing further problems.

Sign up here.\n\nCNN —\n\nAnwar Abdul Nabi perches on the edge of a bed at the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza. Her eyes are sunken with grief.\n\nThe young mother tenderly holds the fingers of her daughter, Mila. Just minutes ago, the 3-year-old girl died of starvation.\n\n“My daughter was taken into to God’s mercy, because of the lack of calcium, potassium and oxygen,” Nabi told CNN on Monday, as she cried into the arms of an elderly relative. “Suddenly, everything dropped, because she was not eating anything with iron, or eggs. She used to eat eggs every day before the war. Now nothing. She passed away.”\n\nAs Israel’s severe restrictions on aid entering the Gaza Strip drain essential supplies, displaced Palestinians told CNN they are struggling to feed their children. Starving mothers are unable to produce enough milk to breastfeed their babies, doctors say. Parents arrive at overwhelmed health facilities begging for infant formula. In northern Gaza, people rush to grab aid from infrequent humanitarian drops. Health workers say they cannot offer life-saving treatment to malnourished Gazans because Israel’s bombardment and siege has crushed the medical system.\n\nThe Ministry of Health in Gaza said Tuesday that since the beginning of the war, 364 health workers had been killed; 269 medical staff arrested; 155 health facilities “destroyed,” and 155 ambulances “targeted.” CNN cannot independently confirm the numbers due to the lack of international media access to Gaza.\n\nIsrael launched its military offensive in Gaza after the militant group Hamas killed at least 1,200 people and kidnapped more than 250 others in southern Israel on October 7.\n\nSince then, Israel’s attacks on Gaza have killed at least 30,717 Palestinians and wounded another 72,156 people, according to the Ministry of Health in the enclave, while its siege has drastically diminished vital supplies and left the enclave’s population of some 2.2 million people exposed to high levels of acute food insecurity or worse, according to the Integrated Food Security and Nutrition Phase Classification (IPC), which assesses global food insecurity and malnutrition.\n\nAt least 20 Palestinians have starved to death in Gaza, Dr. Ashraf Al-Qudra, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Health, said on Wednesday. The youngest baby who died of starvation in the enclave was one day old, according to Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, director of Kamal Adwan hospital. The true number could be even higher, as limited access to northern Gaza has hindered the ability of aid agencies to fully assess the situation there. UN experts accused Israel of “intentionally starving” Palestinians in Gaza. Israel insists there is “no limit” on the amount of aid that can enter Gaza, but its inspection regime on aid trucks has meant that only a tiny fraction of the amount of food and other supplies that used to enter Gaza daily before the war is getting in now.\n\nChildren, mothers at risk\n\nOne-year-old Watin, in northern Gaza, has grown tired and weak from dehydration. Instead of drinking baby formula, she is surviving on one to two dates a day.\n\n“She is only taking one meal,” said her father, Ikhlas Shehadeh, who struggles to scavenge enough food to feed his baby girl. “She spent a long time without any milk. This child is suffering from the inability to move,” he told CNN on Tuesday. “We do not know what to do.”\n\nThe babies of thousands of women “who are due to give birth in the next month in the Gaza Strip are at risk of dying,” the UNICEF State of Palestine Humanitarian Situation report said on Tuesday. At least 5,500 pregnant women “do not have access to prenatal or postnatal check-ups because of bombings and need to flee for safety,” the report said.\n\n“Anxiety is also leading to premature births,” the report added, citing the United Nations Population Fund (UNPF.) The report also said over 90% of children “aged 6-23 months and pregnant, breastfeeding women face severe food poverty with access to two or fewer food groups per day.”\n\nAnwar Abdul Nabi, a young mother whose 3-year-old daughter, Mila, had died of malnutrition minutes earlier. Israel's siege on Gaza has consigned Palestinians in the enclave to deadly starvation. CNN\n\nFood shortages are reportedly the worst in northern Gaza, where Israel concentrated its military offensive in the early days of the war. Child malnutrition in the region is about three times higher than in southern Gaza, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Screenings at health facilities there have previously found at least one in six children under the age of two are acutely malnourished, said Richard Peeperkorn, WHO representative for the territory. He warned those figures are “likely to be greater today.” Pregnant and breastfeeding women also face “grave threats to their health” caused by malnutrition, the Global Nutrition Cluster, an alliance of NGOs, reported in February.\n\nDr. Muhammad Salha, acting director of Al-Awda Hospital, in northern Gaza, told CNN medical workers are treating cases of dehydration, gastroenteritis, and hepatitis among women and children.\n\n“There are babies who died in their mothers’ wombs, and surgeries were performed to remove the dead fetuses,” he said on Monday. “Mothers are not eating because of the conditions we are living in, and this affects the infants … There are causes of many children suffering from dehydration and malnutrition, leading to death.”\n\nA Palestinian child suffering from malnutrition receives treatment at a healthcare center in Rafah, in southern Gaza, on March 4. Children and mothers are among those most at risk of severe malnutrition. Mohammed Salem/Reuters\n\nIsrael’s bombardment has forcibly displaced at least 1.7 million Palestinians, according to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Many of those who fled the fighting are crammed into overwhelmed shelters without basic sanitation, leading to the spread of infections. Malnourished children, especially those with severe malnutrition, are at greater risk of dying from illnesses like diarrhea and pneumonia, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nAnother doctor in northern Gaza, Ahmad Salem, said patients in intensive care and neonatal units were dying from malnutrition and a lack of oxygen, which are difficult to administer amid fuel shortages. “We suffer from starvation of mothers,” the medical worker in the Kamal Adwan Hospital told CNN. “We cannot find an alternative to mother’s milk, which leads to the death of those children.”\n\n‘We have become like dogs’\n\nFootage obtained by CNN shows scores of desperate civilians clambering over each other to grab ration packs from aid drops in northern Gaza.\n\nOn Tuesday, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt sent 42 tons of medical supplies and food via airplanes in the region, the Emirati Ministry of Defense said. The US military said it had, alongside the Royal Jordanian Air Force, parachuted more than 36,800 meals into northern Gaza that day.\n\nPalestinians watch as the US military carries out its first aid drop over Gaza City, in northern Gaza, on March 2. Human rights groups say the drops are a degrading way of getting aid to Gazans. Kosay Al Nemer/Reuters\n\nBut human rights groups criticized the drops as inefficient and a degrading way of getting aid to Gazans, urging Israeli authorities to lift controls on land crossings into the enclave. Melanie Ward, the CEO of the UK-based NGO, Medical Aid for Palestinians, urged Israel to “immediately open all crossings into Gaza for aid workers to assist those in need.”\n\n“Only safe and unfettered access for aid and aid workers, the lifting of the siege, and an immediate ceasefire can end starvation in Gaza,” she said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nEven when aid does make it into the strip, collecting it can be dangerous.\n\nIsraeli forces opened fire on people waiting for aid on Monday in northern Gaza, eyewitnesses told CNN, in an incident that took place shortly before midnight at the Kuwait Roundabout on Rasheed Street in Gaza City. CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment.\n\nLast Thursday, at least 118 people were killed while trying to access food aid in Gaza City in one of the worst single tragedies of the war so far. Palestinian health officials said Israeli troops had used live fire as hungry and desperate Palestinian civilians were gathering around food trucks, with Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, referring to the incident as an “outrageous massacre.” The Israeli military said it first opened fire with warning shots for crowd control, before firing on “looters” who came toward them. Most of the dead were killed by ramming as aid truck drivers tried to escape the gunfire and chaos, eyewitnesses and the IDF both said. CNN is unable to independently confirm the figures.\n\nFaraj Abu Naji, whose sister gave birth to twin girls a week ago, managed to obtain just three cartons of milk for his newborn nieces in an aid drop in northern Gaza. He told CNN that he injured his foot while trying to buy flour along Al-Rashid Street.\n\n“We thank God that there is humanitarian aid being dropped from Jordanian and Emirati planes,” he said on Tuesday. “I try as much as possible to obtain milk from the planes that drop aid so that we can provide milk for my nieces for as long as possible.\n\n“Planes are dropping aid on northern Gaza, and we have become like dogs, running after a bone.”\n\nThis story has been updated to correct Mila’s age. She was 3.",

Food supplies have been drastically reduced due to Israel's siege on the enclave, resulting in children and mothers suffering from malnutrition, dehydration, and related illnesses. At least 20 Palestinians have died of starvation, including a three-year-old girl, while malnutrition rates in northern Gaza are three times higher than in the south. Aid drops by neighboring countries have been criticized as insufficient and degrading, while Israeli forces have opened fire on civilians seeking assistance, further hindering access to lifesaving supplies."

                        "publisher": "USA TODAY",
                        "newstext": "Five months after a stunningly brutal attack on Israel prompted the devastating siege of Gaza, the numbers are as mind-numbing as the gruesome videos that emerge almost daily from the embattled enclave.\n\nMore than 1,500 Hamas-led militants stormed across the fortified border Oct. 7, killing almost 1,200 people in Israel before retreating back into Gaza with more than 240 hostages in tow. Within hours of the attack, Israel unleashed an aerial bombardment on Gaza, and on Oct. 27 the ground invasion began − resulting in a staggering humanitarian crisis over the following months that grows increasingly dire by the day.\n\nToday more than 30,000 Palestinians are dead, tens of thousands more are wounded, hundreds of thousands are struggling to avoid starvation, and 1.7 million have been displaced from their homes. Talks aimed at reaching a cease-fire have been unsuccessful, and the Israeli military continues bombardment on the enclave.\n\nImages of the suffering have been seen around the world, resulting in international protests. The U.S. is the largest provider of aid to Gaza, sending more than $180 million in humanitarian assistance since the war began. But the few hospitals still able to provide care are overwhelmed. The few aid trucks that get through are overrun by desperate families at risk of starvation. In recent days, the U.S. and Jordan have begun humanitarian airdrops.\n\nThe U.N. Relief and Works Agency says that 17,000 children have been orphaned and that in northern Gaza, 1 in 6 children under age 2 are acutely malnourished. UNICEF regional director Adele Khodr said the demand for nutritious food, safe water and medical services is growing more severe as humanitarian agencies struggle to function in the war zone. People are hungry, exhausted and traumatized, Khodr said.\n\n\"The child deaths we feared are here and are likely to rapidly increase unless the war ends and obstacles to humanitarian relief are immediately resolved,\" Khodr said. \"We need reliable, multiple entry points that would allow us to bring aid in from all possible crossings ... with no denials, delays and access impediments.\"\n\nWith truck convoys unable to meet the demand, the U.S. Department of Defense and the Jordanian Royal Air Force have collaborated to airdrop 70,000 meals into Gaza in recent days. It's not nearly enough.\n\nThe Biden administration, Egypt and Qatar are brokering talks aimed at resolving the crisis. The latest proposal calls for a six-week cease-fire, release of the sick, wounded, elderly and female hostages, and a large-scale increase in crucial humanitarian aid, the White House said.\n\n\"Responding to the humanitarian crisis and the needs of the Palestinian people has been a priority since Day One,\" White House national security communications adviser John Kirby said Monday. But in the U.N. Security Council, calls for an immediate cease-fire have been vetoed by the U.S., where officials maintain such a resolution is meaningless and could disrupt efforts at reaching a negotiated agreement.\n\nA war with no walls:Inside the devastating impact of Israel-Hamas war around the globe\n\nHas the West lost its 'moral mooring'?\n\nDr. Mehran Kamrava, a professor of government at Georgetown University Qatar, says both sides have been guilty of crimes against humanity.\n\n\"For millions of people across the world, the West has lost its moral mooring once and for all,\" Kamrava said. \"Western hypocrisy, loudly proclaiming the virtues of human rights but ignoring the deaths of thousands of Palestinians in most horrific ways, is difficult to comprehend. How could the United States, that self-declared bastion of peace around the world, repeatedly veto United Nations cease-fire resolutions to stop the war?\"\n\nIsrael, Hamas at odds on cease-fire proposals\n\nKirby says Israel has agreed to a cease-fire framework and \"now the onus is on Hamas to do the same.\" Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan, however, insists that Israel's military withdraw from Gaza and that displaced Palestinians be allowed to return to their homes. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is also raising concerns, refusing to send a delegation to the talks in Cairo until Hamas provides an accounting of the hostages, including how many are alive and their conditions.\n\nHamas has said that the hostages are being held by multiple militant groups − the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Mujahideen Brigades and Al-Nasser Salah al-Deen Brigades are among those claiming custody − scattered around Gaza and that a cease-fire is required to track all the hostages down. The United States has for years designated Hamas a terrorist organization.\n\nZev Faintuch, senior intelligence analyst at the security firm Global Guardian, says Israel won't be deterred from crushing Hamas and hunting down Hamas leaders.\n\n\"No external pressure will prevent Israel from finishing the job − that is, eradicating Hamas’ infrastructure, degrading its fighting capabilities and creating the foundation for a Hamas-free future Gaza,\" he said.\n\nIsrael's war on Gaza Strip:Mapping the devastation\n\nAmericans split politically on halting military aid to Israel\n\nAccording to one poll, 52% of Americans believe the U.S. should halt weapons shipments to Israel until its military pulls out of Gaza, while 27% disagree and 21% are unsure, according to a new YouGov poll commissioned by the Center for Economic and Policy Research. The poll, however, shows a partisan split: 62% of President Joe Biden's supporters favor the halt in shipments, while only 30% of Donald Trump supporters want the shipments discontinued.\n\nWill Hamas decide to compromise?\n\nAvi Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence official and author of “Inside The Middle East: Entering A New Era,\" said Hamas' negotiating strength is fading as the holy month of Ramadan draws near. Netanyahu's resolve shows no signs of winding down the fighting until Hamas is broken and the hostages are returned, Melamed said.\n\nHamas, he said, will need to compromise. The final deal is likely to provide a temporary pause, but the war won't end, and Israel will once again set its military sights on the crowded city of Rafah.\n\n\"The deal won’t likely be perfect for Israel, as no doubt it will need to free some terrorists with blood on their hands,\" he said.\n\nIn the long term, Hamas is drawing \"furious\" criticism in the Arab world and will be weakened, Melamed said. He foresees a revitalized Palestinian Authority that Biden and the West have called for, with Hamas most likely playing a role.\n\nHamas attack was among world's deadliest\n\nThe Hamas attack was the third-deadliest terrorist attack since data collection began in 1970, according to the Washington-based Center for Strategic & International Studies. The deadliest was the 9/11 attack by al-Qaida on the U.S. in 2001 that killed almost 3,000 people, followed by an Islamic State attack in Tikrit, Iraq, in 2014 that killed 1,700.\n\nOn Oct. 7, the Hamas-led militants killed almost 1,200 people after crashing through a 40-mile-long border wall outfitted with machine-gun turrets and observation towers, cameras, radars, barbed wire and an underground concrete barrier to frustrate tunneling. Hamas struck on a Saturday morning after the end of Sukkot, a weeklong celebration to commemorate the harvest season and the time Jews lived in the desert after being freed from slavery in Egypt.\n\nThe militants used drones to drop explosives onto the observation towers, blew holes in the border fence with explosives and bulldozers to smash open gaps large enough to allow vehicles to roll through. Several military outposts were struck first, slowing the defensive response, and communities, kibbutzim and a large music festival were invaded in the deadly rampages.\n\nU.N. envoy Pramila Patten said this week that evidence indicates the militants committed rape and \"sexualized torture'' of women during the attack and on some of the hostages\n\nScores of militants were killed then, and Israel says it has killed more than 10,000 since. More than 240 Israeli soldiers have also died in the ground assault, and more than 100 hostages remain captives of Hamas and other militant groups.\n\nThe Israeli government blames the civilian death toll in Gaza on Hamas efforts to hide among civilians they use as human shields. Netanyahu has vowed to keep fighting until Hamas and its leaders are crushed.\n\n\"Netanyahu’s relentless refusal to halt the war will leave scars on the collective memory of Israelis for years to come,\" Kamrava said. \"President Biden will go down in history as Netanyahu’s unwitting enabler in one of the 21st century’s worst episodes of mass killings.\"",

Several military outposts were struck first, slowing the defensive response, and communities, kibbutzim and a large music festival were invaded in the deadly rampages.</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">U.N. envoy Pramila Patten&#160;said this week that evidence indicates the militants committed rape and \"sexualized torture'' of women during the attack and on some of the hostages</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Scores of militants were killed then, and Israel says it has killed more than 10,000 since. More than 240 Israeli soldiers have also died in the ground assault, and more than 100 hostages remain captives of Hamas and other militant groups.</p><p id=\"~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-news-world-israel-hamas-8\" class=\"gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al\"></p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">The Israeli government blames the civilian death toll in Gaza on Hamas efforts to hide among civilians they use as human shields.

Over 30,000 Palestinians have died, hundreds of thousands are facing starvation, and 1.7 million have been displaced. Talks for a cease-fire have been unsuccessful, and Israel continues its bombardment on the enclave, while humanitarian aid struggles to reach those in need. The U.S. has been the largest provider of aid, but hospitals are overwhelmed, and food supplies are running low. International protests have criticized the conflict, and the U.N. has condemned the humanitarian crisis, calling for an immediate end to the violence."

                "newstext": "CNN —\n\nTwo Filipino seafarers are among the dead after a Houthi ballistic missile struck a commercial ship in the Gulf of Aden, marking the first fatal attack by the Iran-backed militant group in its ongoing assaults in the Red Sea.\n\nAt least three crew members were killed and four others injured in the attack Wednesday on the M/V True Confidence, a Barbados-flagged, Liberian-owned bulk carrier, US Central Command said in a statement. The ship has since been abandoned and coalition warships are now in the area assessing the situation, two US officials told CNN.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, the Philippine Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) announced the death of its nationals and said two other Filipino crewmen were severely injured in the attack.\n\nThe deadly strike marks a significant escalation of the Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping, which began in October in response to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe Houthis said in a statement that the strike was “accurate” and caused a fire to break out on the ship.\n\n“The targeting operation came after the ship’s crew rejected warning messages from the Yemeni naval forces,” a Houthi statement said.\n\nThe Houthis, having taken control of most of northern Yemen – including the capital Sanaa – present themselves as the legitimate rulers of the country.\n\nThe Houthi statement reiterated the group’s support for the Palestinian people and said they will not stop their attacks in the Red Sea until Israeli “aggression stops and the siege on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is lifted.”\n\nUS State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Wednesday that the deaths were “sadly inevitable.”\n\n“The Houthis have continued to launch these reckless attacks with no regard for the well-being of innocent civilians who are transiting through the Red Sea, and now they have unfortunately and tragically killed innocent civilians,” Miller said at a briefing.\n\n“The United States will continue to hold the Houthis accountable for their attacks, which have not just disrupted international commerce, not just disrupted the freedom of navigation and international waters, and not just endangered seafarers, but now tragically killed a number of them,” he said.\n\nThe United Nations’ shipping agency chief expressed condolences over the deaths and made renewed calls to protect crew members following the tragedy.\n\n“Innocent seafarers should never become collateral victims,” International Maritime Organization Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez said in a statement.\n\nRed Sea attacks\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 45 missile and drone attacks against commercial and US and coalition naval vessels operating in the Red Sea, according to US and Western officials, most of which have been intercepted by US or coalition destroyers or landed harmlessly in the water.\n\nTo date, no military vessels have been impacted by Houthi UAVs or missiles, according to US Defense Department spokesperson Maj. Pete Nguyen. But more than a dozen commercial ships, including several US vessels, have been hit since October, Nguyen said.\n\nThe US and the United Kingdom have also carried out four rounds of strikes against Houthi targets inside Yemen since January, hitting weapons and missile storage facilities, one-way attack unmanned aerial and air defense systems, radars, and helicopters.\n\nUS Central Command forces have also regularly conducted dynamic strikes against Houthi missiles seen preparing to launch from Yemen.\n\nThe Biden administration has been struggling to stop the attacks, however, and the rebel group has continued to fortify its weapons stockpile in Yemen, CNN previously reported.\n\nMultiple officials told CNN the US still does not have “a denominator” that would allow them to assess the percentage of Houthi equipment the US and the UK have actually destroyed in airstrikes, and it is not clear whether the US will shift its military approach further.\n\n“We know that the Houthis maintain a large arsenal,” Deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said last week, hours after the Houthis hit yet another cargo vessel in the Gulf of Aden with ballistic missiles. “They are very capable, they have sophisticated weapons, and that’s because they continue to get them from Iran.”\n\n“They continue to surprise us,” said one senior defense official, referring to the Houthis. “We just don’t have a good idea of what they still have.”\n\nAnd despite a robust US and coalition presence in the Red Sea, which includes the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier and several US destroyers, the Houthi attacks have caused a massive drop in ships traveling through the Suez Canal.\n\nThe passage links the Red Sea with the Mediterranean Sea, allowing ships to cut thousands of miles off shipping routes instead of sailing around Africa. In the first half of February, the Suez Canal experienced a 42% drop in monthly transits and an 82% decrease in container tonnage from its peak in 2023, according to the UN.\n\nCNN’s Jennifer Hansler, Mostafa Salem, Sharon Braithwaite, Kathleen Magramo and Manveena Suri contributed reporting.",

                        "newstext": "The first fatal attack by Yemen’s Houthi rebels on shipping threatens to further sever a crucial maritime artery for global trade and carries with it risks beyond those just at sea\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- The first fatal attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels on shipping threatens to further sever a crucial maritime artery for global trade and carries with it risks beyond those just at sea.\n\nAlready, the White House is warning that there will be a response to Wednesday's attack on the Barbados-flagged, Liberian-owned bulk carrier True Confidence in the Gulf of Aden. What that will look like remains unclear, but the U.S. already has launched round after round of airstrikes targeting the Houthis, a rebel group that has held Yemen's capital since 2014, and more are likely on the way.\n\nHowever, there's already a wider economic, humanitarian and political impact looming from the attack. It also further highlights Yemen's yearslong war, now overshadowed by Israel's grinding war on Hamas on the Gaza Strip that may reach into the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, raising the danger of worsening regional anger.\n\nSince the onset of the Houthi attacks, the rebels have framed them as a way to pressure Israel to stop the war, which has killed over 30,700 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The war began Oct. 7 with a Hamas attack in Israel that killed about 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage.\n\nBut as shippers began avoiding the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, the rebels began attacking ships with tenuous — or no — ties to Israel or the war. Meanwhile, U.S. and coalition warships have shot down any Houthi fire that's come near them. That's left the rebels targeting commercial ships whose only protection has been armed guards, barbed-wire fencing and water cannons — good enough to deter pirates, but not an anti-ship ballistic missile.\n\nWednesday's attack underlines the danger to those not even involved in the war. The Houthi missile that hit the True Confidence killed two Filipinos and one Vietnamese national. The Iranian-backed Houthis have not acknowledged those deaths and sought to distance themselves from any consequence of their actions.\n\n“We hold America responsible for the repercussions of everything that happens,” Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam wrote online Thursday.\n\nAnother ship sank this past weekend after being abandoned following a Houthi attack.\n\nAlready, the Houthis have attacked at least one ship carrying aid bound for territory they hold. The Greek-flagged, U.S.-owned bulk carrier Sea Champion had been full of grain from Argentina and was bound for Aden and then rebel-held Hodeida when it was hit in February. As hunger stalks the Gaza Strip during the Israel war, so too does it still grip Yemen, the Arab world's poorest country.\n\n“The escalation of the crisis in the Red Sea is likely to worsen the food insecurity situation in Yemen in 2024, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian crisis,” the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization has warned.\n\nThen there are the conflicts gripping East Africa. The World Food Program issued a warning Tuesday regarding its operations in Somalia, saying the shipping crisis is hindering its ability to “maintain its regular flow of humanitarian aid.” In war-torn Sudan, the International Rescue Committee says it has suspended its operations to Port Sudan over hiked costs and other concerns rising from the Houthi attacks.\n\nThen there's the economic pressure. While Israel has described its economy as so far unaffected, the same can't be said for neighboring Egypt. Traffic in its Suez Canal linking the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea onward to Europe has dropped by nearly half, according to U.N. figures.\n\nThose shipping fees provide crucial revenue for Egypt's government, which has allowed the Egyptian pound to rapidly devalue as it reached a deal with the International Monetary Fund to increase its bailout loan from $3 billion to $8 billion. Further economic turmoil could spark unrest in Egypt, less than 15 years on from the 2011 Arab Spring.\n\nSince beginning its campaign of airstrikes in January, the U.S. military has claimed it destroyed over 100 Houthi missiles, according to an Associated Press analysis of its statements. However, that hasn't halted the rebels' ability to launch attacks.\n\nThat's something a Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis learned after launching its own campaign against the rebels beginning in 2015 in support of the country's exiled government. The American strikes so far have been more precise, with only one reported civilian death so far over dozens of attacks.\n\nBut the American involvement has rubbed Saudi Arabia and its main partner, the United Arab Emirates, the wrong way — particularly after President Joe Biden in 2021 came into office and promptly declared that Yemen's war “has to end.” Both countries have avoided actively taking part in the U.S.-led campaign now targeting the rebels. And Saudi Arabia reached a détente a year ago with Iran it hoped would lead to a peace deal, something that still hasn't happened.\n\nFor the Houthis, the fight against Israel and the U.S. may be everything they've wanted. Their Zaydi Shiite group ran a 1,000-year kingdom in Yemen until 1962. Their slogan has long been: “God is the greatest; death to America; death to Israel; curse the Jews; victory to Islam.”\n\nFighting against two of their archenemies allows the rebels to shore up their own support with Yemen, as well as gain international recognition in an Arab world otherwise enraged by the killing of Palestinians in Israel's campaign in the Gaza Strip.

What that will look like remains unclear, but the U.S. already has launched round after round of airstrikes targeting the <a class=\"zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE \" href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/RedSeaAttacks\" id=\"_ap_link_Houthis_RedSeaAttacks_\" target=\"_blank\">Houthis</a>, a rebel group that has held Yemen's capital since 2014, and more are likely on the way.</p><p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">However, there's already a wider economic, humanitarian and political impact looming from the attack. It also further highlights Yemen's yearslong war, now overshadowed by Israel's grinding war on Hamas on the Gaza Strip that may reach into the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, raising the danger of worsening regional anger. </p><p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">Since the onset of the Houthi attacks, the rebels have framed them as a way to pressure Israel to stop the war, which has killed over 30,700 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The war began Oct. 7 with a Hamas attack in Israel that killed about 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. </p><p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">But as shippers began avoiding the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, the rebels began attacking ships with tenuous &#8212; or no &#8212; ties to Israel or the war. Meanwhile, U.S. and coalition warships have shot down any Houthi fire that's come near them. That's left the rebels targeting commercial ships whose only protection has been armed guards, barbed-wire fencing and water cannons &#8212; good enough to deter pirates, but not an anti-ship ballistic missile. </p><p class=\"Ad fitt-article-inline-outstream  ad-slot  \"></p><p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">Wednesday's attack underlines the danger to those not even involved in the war. The Houthi missile that hit the True Confidence killed two Filipinos and one Vietnamese national. The Iranian-backed Houthis have not acknowledged those deaths and sought to distance themselves from any consequence of their actions. </p><p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">&#8220;We hold America responsible for the repercussions of everything that happens,&#8221; Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam wrote online Thursday. </p><p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">Another ship sank this past weekend after being abandoned following a Houthi attack. </p><p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">Already, the Houthis have attacked at least one ship carrying aid bound for territory they hold. The Greek-flagged, U.S.-owned bulk carrier Sea Champion had been full of grain from Argentina and was bound for Aden and then rebel-held Hodeida when it was hit in February. As hunger stalks the Gaza Strip during the Israel war, so too does it still grip Yemen, the Arab world's poorest country. </p><p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">&#8220;The escalation of the crisis in the Red Sea is likely to worsen the food insecurity situation in Yemen in 2024, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian crisis,&#8221; the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization has warned. </p><p class=\"Ad fitt-article-inline-box  ad-slot  \"></p><p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">Then there are the conflicts gripping East Africa. The World Food Program issued a warning Tuesday regarding its operations in Somalia, saying the shipping crisis is hindering its ability to &#8220;maintain its regular flow of humanitarian aid.&#8221; In war-torn Sudan, the International Rescue Committee says it has suspended its operations to Port Sudan over hiked costs and other concerns rising from the Houthi attacks. </p><p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">Then there's the economic pressure. While Israel has described its economy as so far unaffected, the same can't be said for neighboring Egypt. Traffic in its Suez Canal linking the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea onward to Europe has dropped by nearly half, according to U.N. figures. </p><p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">Those shipping fees provide crucial revenue for Egypt's government, which has allowed the Egyptian pound to rapidly devalue as it reached a deal with the International Monetary Fund to increase its bailout loan from $3 billion to $8 billion. Further economic turmoil could spark unrest in Egypt, less than 15 years on from the 2011 Arab Spring. </p><p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">Since beginning its campaign of airstrikes in January, the U.S. military has claimed it destroyed over 100 Houthi missiles, according to an Associated Press analysis of its statements. However, that hasn't halted the rebels' ability to launch attacks. </p><p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">That's something a Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis learned after launching its own campaign against the rebels beginning in 2015 in support of the country's exiled government. The American strikes so far have been more precise, with only one reported civilian death so far over dozens of attacks. </p><p class=\"Ad fitt-article-inline-outstream  ad-slot  \"></p><p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">But the American involvement has rubbed Saudi Arabia and its main partner, the United Arab Emirates, the wrong way &#8212; particularly after President Joe Biden in 2021 came into office and promptly declared that Yemen's war &#8220;has to end.&#8221; Both countries have avoided actively taking part in the U.S.-led campaign now targeting the rebels. And Saudi Arabia reached a d&#233;tente a year ago with Iran it hoped would lead to a peace deal, something that still hasn't happened. </p><p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">For the Houthis, the fight against Israel and the U.S. may be everything they've wanted. Their Zaydi Shiite group ran a 1,000-year kingdom in Yemen until 1962. Their slogan has long been: &#8220;God is the greatest; death to America; death to Israel; curse the Jews; victory to Islam.&#8221;</p><p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy\">Fighting against two of their archenemies allows the rebels to shore up their own support with Yemen, as well as gain international recognition in an Arab world otherwise enraged by the killing of Palestinians in Israel's campaign in the Gaza Strip. If fighting there goes into Ramadan, a time in Islam for peace and reflection, it may inspire a further spread of militant violence. ___</p><p class=\"EkqkG nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN\">EDITOR&#8217;S NOTE &#8212; Jon Gambrell, the news director for the Gulf and Iran for The Associated Press, has reported from each of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Iran, Yemen and other locations across the Mideast and wider world since joining the AP in 2006.</p></div>",

Kathy Hochul announced plans Wednesday to send the National Guard to the New York City subway system to help police conduct random searches of riders’ bags for weapons following a series of high-profile crimes on city trains.\n\nHochul, a Democrat, said she will deploy 750 members of the National Guard to the subways to assist the New York Police Department with bag checks at entrances to busy train stations.\n\n“For people who are thinking about bringing a gun or knife on the subway, at least this creates a deterrent effect. They might be thinking, ‘You know what, it just may just not be worth it because I listened to the mayor and I listened to the governor and they have a lot more people who are going to be checking my bags,’” Hochul said at a news conference in New York City.\n\nThe move came as part of a larger effort from the governor’s office to address crime in the subway. She also floated a legislative proposal to ban people from trains for three years if they are convicted of assaulting a subway passenger and said officials would install cameras in conductor cabins to protect transit workers.\n\nThe deployment of the National Guard would bolster an enhanced presence of NYPD officers in the subway system. The governor said she will also send 250 state troopers and police officers from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, a state agency, to help with the bag searches.\n\nHochul has tried to mount a more aggressive public safety messaging strategy after Republicans campaigned on crime concerns and performed well in House races around New York City in the 2022 elections.\n\nHer subway plan is “another unfortunate example of policymaking through overreaction and overreach,” Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement.\n\n“Sound policy making will not come from overreacting to incidents that, while horrible and tragic, should not be misrepresented as a crime wave and certainly don’t call for a reversion to failed broken windows policies of the past,” she said, referring to the policing theory that going after smaller crimes can help stem greater disorder.\n\nOverall, crime has dropped in New York City since a spike during the COVID-19 pandemic, and killings are down on the subway system. But rare fatal shootings and shovings on the subway can put residents on edge. Just last week, a passenger slashed a subway conductor in the neck, delaying trains.\n\nPolice in New York have long conducted random bag checks at subway entrances, though the practice has been applied sporadically. Passengers are free to refuse the searches and leave the station. Critics have often raised questions about whether the searches are an effective policing tactic in a subway system that serves over 3 million riders per day.",

Kathy Hochul announced her new five-point plan alongside MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber at the NYC Transit Rail Control Center on West 54th Street in Manhattan. It aims to use state resources to shore up subway safety.\n\nThe plan includes surging state personnel to help with the NYPD bag checks, proposing a bill to allow judges to ban more violent offenders from the system, adding new cameras for conductor cabins, increasing prosecutorial and law enforcement coordination and deploying more outreach teams along with existing Safe Options Support (SOS) ones.\n\nThe state personnel surge includes 750 National Guard members and 250 personnel from MTA and State Police, totaling 1,000, and the effort was underway the same day she announced it. The idea, Hochul says, is for people to have a felt sense of safety.

These brazen, heinous attacks on our subway system will not be tolerated,\" Hochul said. \"This will not stand -- not on my watch.\"\n\nThe governor's subway plan is “another unfortunate example of policymaking through overreaction and overreach,” Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement.\n\n“Sound policy making will not come from overreacting to incidents that, while horrible and tragic, should not be misrepresented as a crime wave and certainly don’t call for a reversion to failed broken windows policies of the past,” she said, referring to the policing theory that going after smaller crimes can help stem greater disorder.\n\nPolice in New York have long conducted random bag checks at subway entrances, though passengers are free to refuse and leave the station, raising questions of whether the searches are an effective policing tactic in a subway system that serves over three million riders per day.\n\nAdams did not join Hochul at the podium Wednesday due to what the governor said was a scheduling conflict, but he did appear on four different TV stations and displayed a poster to highlight his focus on repeat offenders.\n\n\"We don’t have a surge in crime, we have a surge in recidivism,\" said Adams.\n\nWednesday's developments come on the heels of Adams' announcement about enhanced bag checks at certain subway stations starting this week. He didn't immediately say which stations would see enhanced security, but according to City Hall, police will be deploying 94 bag screening teams to 136 subway stations each week.\n\nSome of the state-run bag checks started Wednesday at key transit hubs, including Grand Central, while full deployment is likely to be completed by week's end, officials say. Intelligence, threat assessments and passenger volume will factor into the locations of the NYPD checkpoints, City Hall said. Adams also said the city continues to review metal-detection technology for subway entry, but nothing is imminent.\n\nAfter a bump in subway crime compared to 2023, the NYPD and the city will be increasing the frequency of bag checks at subway stations. NBC New York's Andrew Siff reports.\n\nOverall, crime has dropped in New York City since a spike during the COVID-19 pandemic, and killings are down on the subway system. But rare fatal shootings and shovings on the subway can put residents on edge — and a few high-profile cases of subway violence have killed and injured a number of New Yorkers in multiple boroughs as of late.\n\nLast week, a subway conductor was knifed in the neck in Brooklyn, a 27-year-old was slashed in the hand in Manhattan and a 61-year-old man was stabbed in the stomach in the Bronx in three unrelated incidences of transit violence within 36 hours. This week, a man was kicked to the tracks at Penn Station. In the last 24 hours, another rider was victimized in an unprovoked hammer attack at a Queens station, while one was attacked with an umbrella on the Upper East Side.\n\nAnd about an hour after Hochul's press conference wrapped up, police were investigating a report of an MTA employee in her 30s being struck in the head, possibly with a bottle, as a southbound 4 train was pulling into 149th Street and Grand Concourse in the Bronx. The conductor was taken to Lincoln Hospital with minor injuries; the suspect ran off.\n\nA recent trio of homicides also made headlines.\n\nAnother MTA worker has been violently attacked while on the job. The A train conductor stuck his head out of the conductor's window when the train stopped at Rockaway Avenue in Brooklyn when someone rushed up and slashed his neck. The suspect is still on the run. NBC New York's Myles Miller reports.\n\nMTA officials, union representatives and elected leaders at all levels of government have decried the violence.\n\nRecent NYPD data paints a concerning picture, with 2023 seeing the highest number of subway assaults since at least 1996. Over that year, there were 570 assaults, marking a slight increase from the previous year and averaging about 1.5 incidents daily.\n\nBut NYPD Chief of Transit Michael Kemper says progress is being made. An infusion of 1,000 more officers into the subway system — done in direct response to a January spike that featured a 45% jump in crime, according to Kemper — led to a 17% reduction in crime in February, Kemper said.\n\nThe NYPD is searching for the man behind a subway kick that sent a man onto the tracks. The incident occurred Sunday night at 34th Street-Penn Station. Police said the suspect is on the run, but they're putting out a photo hoping it helps them track him down. NBC New York's Marc Santia reports.\n\nThat crime spike came after the city ended its police overtime program in the subway at the end of 2023. It was not clear whether the city or state, or some combination, would foot the bill for the estimated $15 million a month that the extra policing costs.\n\nMayor Adams asked the governor for money to cover those costs, to which Hochul replied that the city is no longer in dire straits financially.\n\n\"The mayor has many requests before us in our state legislature. Many, many requests. And I’m glad to see their surpluses and finances are looking better than they had been,\" said Hochul.\n\nFor the year, subway crime is still up 13% compared to 2023, with assaults on the transit system up 11%. NYPD transit police are investigating 86 assaults, up from last year's 77. And three homicides in the first two months of the year mark a troubling start, especially when compared to 2023 at this time, when there were none.\n\nAnthony Izaguirre of the Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Reuters\n\nThe verdict pins a large part of the blame of Hutchins’ death on the armorer after the film’s assistant director David Halls pleaded no contest to negligent handling of a firearm last year.\n\nBaldwin, the movie’s star actor and co-producer, was indicted in January on a charge of involuntary manslaughter.\n\nHe was pointing a gun at Hutchins on the movie set when the gun went off with a live bullet loaded in the chamber, killing her and wounding director Joel Souza.\n\nBaldwin has maintained he never pulled the trigger – which contradicts the FBI’s ruling that the revolver could not have fired without the trigger being clipped.\n\nHis case is scheduled to go to trial in July.\n\nHutchins’ parents Olga Solovey and Anatolli Androsovych, and her sister, Svetlana Zemko, said in a statement through their attorney they are “satisfied” with Gutierrez-Reed’s conviction.\n\n“We look forward to the justice system continuing to make sure that everyone else who is responsible for Halyna’s death is required to face the legal consequences for their actions,” the family said.\n\nWith Post Wires",

                        "newstext": "SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — A jury convicted a movie weapons supervisor of involuntary manslaughter Wednesday in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer by actor Alec Baldwin during a rehearsal on the set of the Western movie “Rust.”\n\nThe verdict against movie armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed assigned new blame in the October 2021 shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins after an assistant director last year pleaded no contest to negligent handling of a firearm.\n\nGutierrez-Reed also had faced a second charge of tampering with evidence, stemming from accusations that she handed a small bag of possible narcotics to another crew member after the shooting to avoid detection. She was found not guilty on that count.\n\nImmediately after the verdict was read in court, the judge ordered the 26-year-old armorer placed into the custody of deputies. Lead attorney Jason Bowles said afterward that Gutierrez-Reed will appeal the conviction, which carries a penalty of up to 18 months in prison and a $5,000 fine.\n\nSanta Fe-based state district court Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer did not immediately set a sentencing date.\n\nBaldwin, the lead actor and a co-producer on “Rust,” was indicted by a grand jury in January on a charge of involuntary manslaughter. He was pointing a gun at Hutchins on a movie set outside Santa Fe, New Mexico, when the gun went off, killing the cinematographer and wounding director Joel Souza.\n\nThe trial was a preamble to Baldwin’s trial scheduled in July. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nMessages seeking comment about Wednesday’s verdict from Baldwin’s spokeswoman and a lawyer were not immediately returned.\n\nProsecutors said at trial that Gutierrez-Reed unknowingly brought live ammunition onto the movie set, and it remained there for at least 12 days before the fatal shooting, giving the armorer plenty of time to remove it.\n\nIn closing arguments, prosecutor Kari Morrissey described “constant, never-ending safety failures” on the set of “Rust” and Gutierrez-Reed’s “astonishing lack of diligence” with gun safety.\n\n“We end exactly where we began — in the pursuit of justice for Halyna Hutchins,” Morrissey told jurors. “Hannah Gutierrez failed to maintain firearms safety, making a fatal accident willful and foreseeable.”\n\nJury hears closing arguments in trial of armorer over fatal shooting by Alec Baldwin AP correspondent Margie Szaroleta reports on closing arguments in the involuntary manslaughter trial for the armorer on the Alec Baldwin movie “Rust.”\n\nProsecutors also contended that the armorer repeatedly skipped or skimped on standard gun-safety protocols that might have detected the live rounds.\n\n“This was a game of Russian roulette every time an actor had a gun with dummies,” Morrissey said.\n\nAn attorney for Hutchins’ parents and sister issued a statement expressing their satisfaction with Wednesday’s verdict.\n\n“Today was the first trial and conviction in the criminal justice process,” said the statement from Gloria Allred on behalf of parents Olga Solovey and Anatolli Androsovych and Hutchins’ sister, Svetlana Zemko. “We look forward to the justice system continuing to make sure that everyone else who is responsible for Halyna’s death is required to face the legal consequences.”\n\nInside the courtroom Wednesday, Gutierrez-Reed’s mother reacted with dismay at the conviction, bursting into tears and cursing the proceedings as her daughter was led away.\n\nDefense attorneys told jurors that the problems on the set extended far beyond Gutierrez-Reed’s control, including the mishandling of weapons by Baldwin, citing sanctions and findings by state workplace safety investigators.\n\nThe defense also cast doubt on accusations that Gutierrez-Reed brought live rounds to the set and said an Albuquerque-based ammunition supplier was never fully investigated.\n\nJuror Alberto Sanchez said Gutierrez-Reed could have paused work on the set to address safety issues. Jurors concluded she brought live ammunition on set, whether she knew it or not, Sanchez said outside of court after jurors were dismissed.\n\n“Pretty much it was just that (she) never did the safety checks,” said Sanchez, whose work nearby in Los Alamos has involved safety decisions. “Never checked the rounds, to pull them out to shake them. I mean, if she’d have done that this wouldn’t have happened.”\n\nBowles, the defense attorney, had told jurors that no one in the cast and crew thought there were live rounds on set and Gutierrez-Reed could not have foreseen that Baldwin would “go off-script” when he pointed the revolver at Hutchins. Investigators found no video recordings of the shooting.\n\n“It was not in the script for Mr. Baldwin to point the weapon,” Bowles said. “She didn’t know that Mr. Baldwin was going to do what he did.”\n\nTo drive the point home, Bowles played a video outtake from another day in which Baldwin fired a revolver loaded with blanks — including a shot after a director calls “cut.”\n\nOn the day of the shooting, Bowles said, Gutierrez-Reed alone was segregated in a police car away from others, becoming a convenient scapegoat.\n\n“You had a production company on a shoestring budget, an A-list actor that was really running the show,” Bowles said. “At the end, they had somebody they could all blame.”\n\nDozens of witnesses had testified during the 10-day trial, from FBI experts in firearms and crime-scene forensics to a camera dolly operator who described the fatal gunshot and watching Hutchins go flush and lose feeling in her legs before death.\n\nThe prosecution painstakingly assembled photographic evidence it said traced the arrival and spread of live rounds on set and argued that Gutierrez-Reed repeatedly missed opportunities to ensure safety and treated basic gun protocols as optional.\n\nThe defense had cast doubt on the relevance of photographs of ammunition, noting FBI testimony that live rounds can’t be fully distinguished from dummy ones on sight.\n\nProsecutors said six live rounds found on set bear mostly identical characteristics and don’t match live rounds seized from the movie’s supplier in Albuquerque. Defense attorneys said the cluttered supply office was not searched until a month after the shooting, undermining the significance of physical evidence.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the last name of Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer.",

Please enter a valid email address.\n\nAlec Baldwin is due in court this summer to face his own involuntary manslaughter charge in the 2021 fatal shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.\n\nHannah Gutierrez-Reed was convicted Wednesday of involuntary manslaughter by a New Mexico jury who determined the 26-year-old \"Rust\" armorer was responsible for the gun that discharged a live bullet on the Western film set. Hutchins was in the line of fire when Baldwin pulled the gun out of his holster on Oct. 21, 2021.\n\nThe decision in Gutierrez-Reed's case may hint at what's to come for Baldwin, who has been charged twice in Hutchins' death. Baldwin was originally charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter on Jan. 31, 2023, but the charges were later dropped in April 2023.\n\n\"With this guilty verdict, Alec Baldwin is probably getting nervous,\" Miguel Custodio, co-founder of Custodio and Dubey LLP, told Fox News Digital. \"He can see that the consequences of what happened are becoming real.\"\n\nALEC BALDWIN'S ‘RUST’ ARMORER CONVICTED OF INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER\n\nCustodio added, \"It remains to be seen whether a jury in his case would be encouraged to hand out another guilty verdict given that someone from that set is already facing a potential jail sentence.\"\n\nAfter Gutierrez-Reed's verdict was read, Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer ordered the armorer be taken into custody, where she will remain until she is sentenced. She faces up to 18 months in prison in addition to a $5,000 fine.\n\nALEC BALDWIN'S ‘PRIMA DONNA’ BEHAVIOR ON ‘RUST’ SET NOT TO BLAME FOR ARMORER'S SAFETY FAILURES: PROSECUTION\n\nThe armorer's trial, which began Feb. 21, saw testimony from weapons experts, FBI and Santa Fe County authorities and crew members who witnessed the fatal shooting. The prosecution largely focused on Gutierrez-Reed's behavior as an armorer, saying she didn't do her job correctly.\n\n\"Interestingly, it was Gutierrez-Reed who presented the most evidence as to Baldwin’s culpability,\" Kate Mangels, partner at Kinsella Holley Iser Kump Steinsapir LLP, told Fox News Digital. \"Her attorneys presented Baldwin as failing in his role as part of the ‘Rust’ production team and as an actor.\"\n\n\"This strategy could be used by the prosecution in Baldwin’s case to increase the chances that a jury finds him culpable in one of those roles. The prosecution's case against Baldwin will depend largely on whether the crew witnesses who testified against Gutierrez-Reed testify similarly against Baldwin.\"\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\nNeama Rahmani, president of West Coast Trial Lawyers, told Fox News Digital that Baldwin has \"a couple things to be concerned about\" heading into his own trial.\n\n\"I think Baldwin has to point the finger at Hannah … and I think Dave Halls a bit as well because he did say during his previous statements to law enforcement that Halls told them it was a cold gun,\" Rahmani said.\n\n\"The FBI report … the ballistics report says he pulled the trigger. I think that's something he's going to have to deal with.\"\n\nBaldwin has maintained in multiple interviews that he did not pull the trigger of the gun. The actor, 65, described the moment the gun was discharged during a TV appearance in December 2021, months after the fatal shooting.\n\nWATCH: ALEC BALDWIN'S FIRST WORDS TO DETECTIVES REVEALED AS POLICE RELEASE TROVE OF ‘RUST’ FILES\n\n\"I let go of the hammer of the gun,\" Baldwin told ABC's George Stephanopoulos. \"And the gun goes off.\"\n\nLucien Haag and Mike Haag, who were commissioned by the prosecution in Hannah Gutierrez-Reed's case, concluded that Baldwin had to pull the trigger of the gun in order for it to fire.\n\nCONVICTED ‘RUST’ ASSISTANT DIRECTOR TESTIFIES ABOUT TENSE FINAL MOMENTS BEFORE FATAL SET SHOOTING\n\n\"Although Alec Baldwin repeatedly denies pulling the trigger, given the tests, findings and observations reported here, the trigger had to be pulled or depressed sufficiently to release the fully cocked or retracted hammer of the evidence revolver,\" reads the report obtained by Fox News Digital. \"This fatal incident was the consequence of the hammer being manually retracted to its fully rearward and cocked position followed, at some point, by the pull or rearward depression of the trigger.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nEmmy-nominated executive producer Paul Epstein questioned overlooked safety protocols on the \"Rust\" set.\n\n\"Why was his finger on the trigger, and why was he pointing a weapon at anyone on set? Both actions violate fundamental firearm safety protocols and underscore the murky delegation of responsibility for safety that, to me, is the real heart of this tragedy,\" Epstein told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"David Halls, the assistant director, testified he felt negligent for not checking the weapon thoroughly. But as a former AD and current producer myself, I know all too well the AD's ability to enforce safety on set is limited by the tolerance of the director and producers.\"\n\nHe added, \"And in the case of this film, both the investigation and statements from the crew make clear that speed and urgency were prioritized – by the film's producers, which include Baldwin himself – over careful risk management.\"\n\nHalls allegedly handed Baldwin a .45 revolver, telling him that it was \"cold\" or safe. Prior to that, Gutierrez-Reed spun the cylinder to show Halls what was in the gun, her lawyer said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHalls signed a plea agreement for a charge of negligent use of a deadly weapon. The terms of his agreement included a suspended sentence and six months of probation, the district attorney announced.\n\nIf Baldwin is convicted, he could face up to 18 months in prison.\n\nRepresentatives for Baldwin did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.",

She faces up to 18 months in prison at sentencing, which is expected sometime in April.\n\nFollowing the verdict, Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer ordered Gutierrez Reed remanded into custody. As her attorney, Monnica Barreras, rubbed her back to comfort her, bailiffs led her away.\n\nOutside the First Judicial District courthouse in Santa Fe, N.M., juror Alberto Sanchez told reporters that the jury reached a “fair” verdict.\n\n“Someone died,” Sanchez said. “You gotta take responsibility. Especially when you’re handling weapons and you’re in charge of those. That’s your job.”\n\nGutierrez Reed was the first person to stand trial in the Oct. 21, 2021, shooting on the film set at the Bonanza Creek Ranch outside Santa Fe, N.M.\n\nAlec Baldwin is set to face his own manslaughter trial in July. The first assistant director, Dave Halls, took a plea deal last year to a misdemeanor count of negligent handling of a gun, and served six months of unsupervised probation.\n\nGutierrez Reed loaded a live bullet into Baldwin’s pistol, which should have contained only dummy rounds. The gun fired, killing Halyna Hutchins and seriously wounding director Joel Souza.\n\nGutierrez Reed got the job largely because her father, Thell Reed, is a legendary film armorer who worked on “Tombstone,” “3:10 to Yuma,” and “L.A. Confidential,” among many others.\n\nThell Reed was in the courtroom when the verdict was read. Though his name was on the defense witness list, he was not called to testify. Stacy Reed, the defendant’s mother, was also there, and was in tears when her daughter was led away.\n\nStacy Reed, mother of Hannah Gutierrez Reed, reacts after hearing the guilty verdict during her daughter’s trial at district court on Wednesday, Mar. 6, 2024.\n\nRachel Mason, a friend of Hutchins’, attended the trial, and is directing and producing a documentary about her life entitled “Halyna.” Interviewed after the verdict, Mason said she was still processing feelings of grief and mourning.\n\n“My overall feeling is extreme sadness that Halyna will continue to not be here,” Mason said. “Hannah going to jail will not change that.”\n\nTo convict on the involuntary manslaughter charge, jurors had to agree that Gutierrez Reed acted with “willful disregard for the safety of others” and that the death was a “foreseeable” consequence of her actions.\n\nShortly before the verdict, the jurors asked a question about what might constitute an “intervening event” that would break the foreseeable chain of events. Marlowe Sommer said that she could not offer further explanation than what was contained in jury instructions.\n\nIn her closing argument on Wednesday morning, prosecutor Kari Morrissey argued that Gutierrez Reed’s actions constituted an “astonishing” failure to adhere to industry safety practices. She argued that Gutierrez Reed was responsible for bringing the live rounds to set, and that she never properly rattle-tested them to ensure they were dummies.\n\nThe jury appeared to agree with that assessment.\n\n“She could have paused work, stopped, and cleared it all up, and just never did,” Sanchez said outside the courthouse. “That was her job to check those rounds — those firearms. No one wanted to pay attention or do that sort of stuff and stop work.”\n\nDefense attorney Jason Bowles countered that a workplace safety investigation laid the blame on management, in part for failing to give Gutierrez Reed adequate time to do her job. He also sought to put blame onto Seth Kenney, the weapons supplier who provided blanks and dummy rounds to the production.\n\nOutside court, Bowles said was disappointed with the verdict and would appeal.\n\n“The evidence wasn’t sufficient to convict,” he said. “It was a lot of guesswork, a lot of speculation.”\n\nMary Carmack-Altwies, the elected district attorney in Santa Fe, issued a statement Wednesday afternoon thanking the jury and thanking Morrissey and Jason Lewis, the outside attorneys whom she appointed as special prosecutors on the case.\n\n“From the outset of this case, the FJDA’s sole pursuits were to bring justice to Halyna Hutchins’ family and friends and to ensure that those responsible for her death were held accountable,” Carmack-Altwies said. “In order to do so, the prosecution team exhausted investigative efforts which proved pivotal to successfully moving forward with this tragic and entirely preventable case.”\n\nMorrissey and Lewis took over the case last March, after Carmack-Altwies and another special prosecutor withdrew.\n\nThe two private attorneys hired a new firearms expert and an imaging expert to enhance photographs. They subpoenaed behind-the-scenes footage, and conducted an exhaustive review of thousands of photos and videos, ultimately concluding that Gutierrez Reed had brought the live rounds to the film set.\n\nSanchez said the jury agreed with that conclusion.\n\nGloria Allred, who has sued Baldwin and the “Rust” producers on behalf of Hutchins’ parents and sister, issued a statement saying she is “satisfied” with the verdict, but that her clients wish for everyone responsible to be held to account.\n\n“Today was the first trial and conviction in the criminal justice process,” Allred and co-counsel John Carpenter said in the statement. “We look forward to the justice system continuing to make sure that everyone else who is responsible for Halyna’s death is required to face the legal consequences for their actions.”\n\nBest of Variety\n\nSign up for Variety’s Newsletter.

                        "newstext": "CNN —\n\nHannah Gutierrez Reed, the “Rust” film armorer, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter Wednesday in a New Mexico trial stemming from the 2021 on-set fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, who was killed by a live round of ammunition fired from a prop gun that was held by actor Alec Baldwin.\n\nGutierrez Reed, who was responsible for firearm safety and storage on the movie’s set, was acquitted of a separate charge of evidence tampering, which was brought after prosecutors alleged she transferred a “small bag of cocaine” to someone else after a police interview on the day of the shooting on October 21, 2021.\n\nJurors deliberated for nearly three hours Wednesday before reaching a decision. The 26-year-old, who did not take the stand in her defense during the trial in Santa Fe, did not show any emotion while the verdict was read. She was then taken into custody.\n\nThe involuntary manslaughter charge carries up to 18 months in prison and a $5,000 fine. The judge did not set a sentencing date.\n\nGutierrez Reed is the first person to stand trial in a case that highlighted the movie industry’s safety standards – and this specific set’s violations of them.\n\nAttorneys representing Hutchins’ parents and sister were satisfied with the jury’s verdict, the attorneys said in a release.\n\n“We look forward to the justice system continuing to make sure that everyone else who is responsible for Halyna’s death is required to face the legal consequences for their actions,” the release reads.\n\nProsecutors argued Gutierrez Reed repeatedly violated safety protocol on set and acted negligently and without caution in performing her duties as armorer, and that her actions ultimately led to Hutchins’ death.\n\n“This is not a case where Hannah Gutierrez made one mistake and that one mistake was accidentally putting a live round into that gun. That’s not what this case is about,” special prosecutor Kari Morrissey said during closing arguments Wednesday.\n\n“This case is about constant, never-ending safety failures that resulted in the death of a human being and nearly killed another,” she added. The film’s director also was injured in the shooting.\n\nGutierrez Reed’s defense attorney Jason Bowles, who has called the shooting a tragic accident, said in closing arguments the armorer could not have known Baldwin would point the weapon toward the cinematographer. And film set management was to blame for safety failures, he said.\n\nBowles’ team plans to appeal the verdict, the attorney told CNN in an email. CNN has also sought comment on the verdict from prosecutors.\n\nDefense argued Gutierrez Reed is scapegoat\n\nBaldwin had been practicing for a scene and was drawing and pointing a revolver with guidance from Hutchins and Joel Souza, the film’s director, according to a probable cause statement filed in January 2023. Souza also was shot but survived.\n\nThe prosecution argued Gutierrez Reed’s failures allowed six live rounds to make their way onto the set, and that she did not conduct vital safety checks of the gun and ammunition that would have caught the live rounds.\n\n“She had six, six live rounds on that movie set, the earliest date that I can track them for you is October 10, (2021),” Morrissey said during Wednesday’s closing arguments. “Six, and she failed to ferret them out for 12 days. What that means is that she wasn’t shaking any dummy rounds, she wasn’t testing anything.”\n\n“If she’s not checking the dummy ammunition during the pendency of the filming to make sure that those rounds that are designed to look like live rounds are in fact dummy rounds, this was a game of Russian roulette every time an actor had a gun with dummies.”\n\nBowles, Gutierrez Reed’s attorney, instead argued in the trial that the blame lies elsewhere and said his client was being used as a scapegoat.\n\nSpecial prosecutor Kari Morrissey, left, and defense attorney Jason Bowles discuss showing a picture to a witness during the trial. Luis Sánchez Saturno/Pool/Santa Fe New Mexican/AP\n\nHe questioned how the live ammunition made it on set and alleged the “Rust” production team created a chaotic and unsafe environment that put Gutierrez Reed under “really tough conditions to keep up with.” And Baldwin did not follow common-sense gun safety rules on set when he handled the firearm and acted unpredictably when he pointed the weapon at Hutchins, Bowles said in his closing statements.\n\n“(Gutierrez Reed) could not anticipate what Baldwin would do. It was not in the script, it was not foreseeable,” he said. “Management was responsible for safety failures and not Hannah.”\n\nBowles also pushed back against the evidence tampering charge, saying a witness had assumed there was cocaine in a small bag Gutierrez Reed handed her on the day of the shooting, but that she quickly threw the bag away and the substance was never tested or confirmed to be the drug.\n\nBaldwin, who has also been charged with involuntary manslaughter, is expected to stand trial in July. He has pleaded not guilty and has maintained he did not pull the trigger.\n\nA government report published roughly six months after the shooting said the movie set “willfully violated” safety rules and “demonstrated plain indifference to employee safety.” Rust Movie Productions, LLC was fined for its actions, CNN has reported.\n\nJurors heard from more than 30 witnesses during the trial – including movie crew members, law enforcement officials and forensics experts – and watched videos of body camera footage from the day of the shooting.\n\nIn one of those clips, Gutierrez Reed told a Santa Fe County sheriff’s corporal there was never live ammunition kept on set and that she had checked the prop guns and the “dummy” rounds the morning before the shooting. Gutierrez Reed told the same officer she checks dummy rounds on set “most of the time.”\n\n“Dummy” rounds refer to ammunition that contains no explosive elements but resemble actual bullets.\n\nAssistant film director David Halls admitted during the trial he was “negligent” in checking the gun and did not properly look through all the rounds in the gun’s chamber when Gutierrez Reed presented it to him.\n\n“She opened up the latch to the revolver, I recall seeing three to four, what I believed to be dummy rounds,” Halls testified. He later added: “I don’t recall her fully rotating the cylinder.”\n\nDavid Halls, assistant film director on \"Rust,\" testifies February 29 during Hannah Gutierrez Reed's involuntary manslaughter trial. Gabriela Campos/Pool/Santa Fe New Mexican/AP\n\nHalls yelled “cold gun” before the weapon was handed to Baldwin, a remark meant to indicate the firearm did not have live rounds, according to a court document. Halls took a plea deal in 2023 for his role in the shooting, pleading no contest to one count of negligent use of a deadly weapon.\n\n“I was negligent in checking the gun properly,” Halls told the court.\n\nHalls was sentenced to six months of unsupervised probation, a $500 fine, had to participate in a firearms safety class, complete 24 hours of community service and not use drugs or alcohol.\n\nIn her closing arguments, Morrissey said there was no evidence someone else was to blame for the shooting, adding Gutierrez Reed was “the autonomous decisionmaker with regard to gun safety” on set.\n\n“Alec Baldwin’s conduct and his lack of gun safety … on that day is something that he’s going to have to answer for. Not with you and not today,” the prosecutor told jurors Wednesday. “That will be with another jury, on another day.”\n\nCNN’s Taylor Romine and Elizabeth Wagmeister contributed to this report.",

The study analyzed data from over 4,000 rivers and found that the amount of water flowing through them has declined significantly over the past four decades. The study suggests that climate change, increased demand from agriculture and industry, and poor water management practices are all contributing to this depletion. The researchers warn that the declining freshwater supply poses a serious threat to human health, food security, and economic development, and they call for immediate action to conserve and manage water resources more sustainably.",

Authorities said he was arrested Wednesday morning in Newark, California, about 14 miles northeast of Google's Silicon Valley headquarters.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nDing, 38, stole more than 500 files detailing Google's information about its AI data center hardware and software — the building blocks for powerful AI models that are currently taking the world by storm — according to the indictment.\n\nDing, through an email address, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Attorney information for Ding was not immediately available.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProsecutors said in the indictment that he created a secret startup in China, unbeknownst to Google, and that he even got a colleague to badge in for him at Google offices in the US so the company wouldn't find out he was secretly working in China.\n\n\"We have strict safeguards to prevent the theft of our confidential commercial information and trade secrets. After an investigation, we found that this employee stole numerous documents, and we quickly referred the case to law enforcement,\" Google's José Castañeda told Business Insider. \"We are grateful to the FBI for helping protect our information and will continue cooperating with them closely.\"\n\nCastañeda also said the situation involved a single junior employee and that it was not a widespread issue at the company.\n\nThe indictment said Ding, who lived in Newark and was a Chinese national, joined Google as a software engineer in 2019. His job involved developing software used in Google's supercomputing data centers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Due to Ding's job responsibilities, he was authorized to access Google Confidential Information related to hardware infrastructure, the software platform, and the AI models and applications they supported,\" the indictment said.\n\nIn May 2022, Ding started secretly uploading confidential information from Google to his private Google Cloud account, the indictment alleged.\n\nAn email from June 2022 showed the CEO of a China-based tech company offered Ding the role of CTO at a salary of $14,800 per month, according to federal prosecutors. The indictment said that while Ding was in China from October 2022 to March 2023, he attended meetings to raise money for that tech company.\n\nBy May 2023, Ding also launched his own China-based tech startup in the AI space and served as acting CEO, according to the indictment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn November 2023, Ding pitched his company at an investor conference, and a document about the company said, \"We have experience with Google's ten-thousand-card computational power platform; we just need to replicate and upgrade it — and then further develop a computational power platform suited to China's national conditions,\" according to the indictment.\n\nIf convicted, Ding could face a $250,000 fine for each count and up to 10 years in prison.\n\n\"The Justice Department will not tolerate the theft of artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies that could put our national security at risk,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement about the indictment.",

While the latest update brings new emoji to all users and new app store capabilities to people in the European Union, it also patches a few issues that Apple said might be actively exploited.\n\nTo download the update, go to Settings > General > Software Update, tap Install Now and follow the onscreen prompts.\n\nAccording to Apple, iOS 17.4 patches two security issues, which affect your iPhone's kernel and RTKit. The kernel is the software at the core of your operating system, while RTKit is Apple's real-time operating system. A real-time operating system is used when a large number of events must be accepted or processed in a certain amount of time, according to the computer science resource site Geeks for Geeks.\n\nApple writes that in both instances, \"An attacker with arbitrary kernel read and write capability may be able to bypass kernel memory protections.\"\n\nMemory protections control how much memory a process has access to. According to Geeks for Geeks, these protections can stop software from taking over an excessive amount of memory, which could harm other software on your device or cause you to lose some of your data.

According to <a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-protection-in-operating-systems/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"c-regularLink\">Geeks for Geeks</a>, these protections can stop software from taking over an excessive amount of memory, which could harm other software on your device or cause you to lose some of your data.

                        "newstext": "The European Union has confirmed it’s looking into Apple’s decision to close Epic Games’ developer account — citing three separate regulations which may apply.\n\nYesterday the Fortnite maker revealed Apple had terminated the account, apparently reversing a decision to approve the developer account last month.\n\nEpic had planned to launch its own app store, the Epic Games Stores, on iOS in Europe, as well as relaunching Fortnight on Apple’s platform. And it accused Apple of breaching the bloc’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) by killing its developer account.\n\nResponding to the development, a European Commission spokesperson told TechCrunch it has “requested further explanations on this from Apple under the DMA”.\n\nThe pan-EU regulation applies on Apple from midnight Brussels’ time today.\n\nThe spokesperson also said the EU is evaluating whether Apple’s actions raise compliance “doubts” with regard to two other regulations — the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Platform-to-Business Regulation (P2B) — given what they described as “the links between the developer program membership and the App store as designated VLOP” (aka very large online platform).\n\nRules the EU’s DMA applies to Apple, as a designated “gatekeeper” and its App Store, as a so-called “core platform service”, require the company to permit third party app stores. Failure to comply with the DMA risks major penalties — of up to 10% of global annual turnover (or 20% for repeat offenders).\n\nWhile a subset of rules in the DSA, which also apply to Apple’s App Store as a designated VLOP, have been in force for larger platforms since August 2023 — with the rest of the regulation’s provisions applying on platforms and many more digital services since last month. Penalties for breaches of the DSA can reach up to 6% of global annual turnover.\n\nThe EU’s P2B regulation, meanwhile, contains measures intended to boost platform transparency and curb unfair practices. It has been in force for longer (since 2020).\n\nUnder the P2B law sudden and unexpected account suspended are banned, with platforms having to provide clear reasons for terminations. However, unlike the DMA and the DSA’s regime for VLOPs, P2B enforcement is not the responsibility of the Commission. It’s devolved to Member State level authorities, which also determine any possible penalties for breaches. Although it’s possible Commission enforcers may factor in whether platforms play nice with P2B rules as part of their assessment of VLOPs’ DSA compliance, given there is some overlap in scope.\n\nEpic has claimed Apple terminated its developer account in retaliation for its criticism of the iPhone maker’s DMA proposal, which requires developers to sign up to new T&Cs that include a new “core technology” in order to tap into DMA entitlements, as “Malicious Compliance”.\n\nYesterday, Apple issued an aggressive statement in response — hitting back at Epic’s accusations, and citing a US court ruling as justification for terminating its account. It also claimed no executive had reviewed Epic’s application to the Apple Developer Program License Agreement, suggesting it was done via a click-through agreement.\n\n“Epic’s egregious breach of its contractual obligations to Apple led courts to determine that Apple has the right to terminate ‘any or all of Epic Games’ wholly owned subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or other entities under Epic Games’ control at any time and at Apple’s sole discretion.’ In light of Epic’s past and ongoing behavior, Apple chose to exercise that right,” Apple wrote yesterday, citing a September 2021 US court ruling pertaining to Epic’s litigation against Apple. The game maker sued Apple in the US, alleging it was abusing its market power by forcing companies to use its own payment systems.\n\nIn September 2021, the US court ruled Apple does not to hold a monopoly in digital mobile gaming transactions. Although it did order it not to prohibit developers from adding links to their apps to direct users to alternative payment systems outside the App Store for the purchase of digital goods.\n\nAt the time, Apple trumpeted the judgement as a win — saying the court had found the App Store does not violate antitrust law. The US court also did not require Apple to allow third-party app stores or sideloading. However, under the EU’s DMA, Apple is required to permit third party app stores and third party software downloads; and must not to block business users from offering wares through their own channels.\n\nThe US court ruling Apple is citing to justify terminating Epic’s developer account is unlikely to have standing in the EU. However Apple may be seeking to play one legal jurisdiction off against another — which has decided its market power is a problem and already passed laws regulating how it can operate its App Store.\n\nApple was contacted for a response to the Commission’s request for further explanations of its actions under the DMA and to the doubts the bloc is raising about its compliance with other measures applied to the App Store by the DSA and P2B. It said it has nothing further to add to the remarks it made yesterday — which argue the US court ruling affirms its contractual right to terminate Epic’s account.\n\nIn those remarks, Apple noted the termination of Epic’s account is not limited to the EU. It said its Developer Program License Agreements (DPLA) are global agreements; claimed Epic’s breach of the DPLA agreement (via its “hotfix” patch which sought to circumvent Apple’s rules by covertly deploying code that let users purchase in-game currency) was also implemented around the world, including in Europe; and suggested the court injunction allowing termination is globally applicable.\n\nThe company also noted Epic continues to litigate against it in the U.S. and Australia.",

The Commission has requested further explanations from Apple regarding its actions under the DMA and is also assessing potential compliance issues with regard to the other two regulations.

                        "newstext": "Epic’s plans to release its own third-party app store on iOS in the EU could be in trouble after Apple terminated the developer account it planned to use. In a blog post published today, the company shared a letter sent by Apple’s lawyers, which called Epic “verifiably untrustworthy” and said Apple does not believe that Epic will comply with its contractual commitments under its developer agreement.\n\n“Please be advised that Apple has, effective immediately, terminated the Developer Program membership of Epic Games Sweden AB,” the letter — which is dated March 2nd — states. It cites Apple’s “contractual right” to terminate its Developer Program License Agreement with the company at “Apple’s sole discretion.”\n\nWhile Apple’s termination of the developer account impacts Epic’s plans to launch its own app store on iOS, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney suggested in a briefing that Epic could still bring Fortnite back to iOS via another company’s third-party app store in the European Union.\n\nApple alluded to its earlier ongoing ban on Epic’s accounts in a statement to The Verge. “Epic’s egregious breach of its contractual obligations to Apple led courts to determine that Apple has the right to terminate ‘any or all of Epic Games’ wholly owned subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or other entities under Epic Games’ control at any time and at Apple’s sole discretion.’ In light of Epic’s past and ongoing behavior, Apple chose to exercise that right,” said spokesperson Fred Sainz.\n\nIn an email dated February 23rd shared by Epic Games, Apple’s Phil Schiller contacted Sweeney to ask for “written assurance” that Epic Games will “honor its commitments.” Schiller cited concerns with Sweeney’s public statements about Apple’s DMA compliance plan and the fact that Epic breached its agreement with Apple in 2020 by adding third-party payment support to Fortnite on iOS, resulting in its removal from the App Store. “In plain, unqualified terms, please tell us why we should trust Epic this time,” Schiller’s email concludes.\n\nSweeney responded the same day. “Epic and its subsidiaries are acting in good faith and will comply with all terms of current and future agreements with Apple, and we’ll be glad to provide Apple with any specific further assurances on the topic that you’d like,” Sweeney wrote.\n\n“Please be advised that Apple has, effective immediately, terminated the Developer Program membership of Epic Games Sweden AB.”\n\nThen, on March 2nd, Apple’s lawyers sent a letter to Epic to say the iPhone maker had terminated Epic Games Sweden’s developer account. “In the past, Epic has denigrated Apple’s developer terms, including the Developer Program License Agreement (DPLA), as a prelude to breaking them,” the letter reads. “Given that pattern, Apple recently reached out directly to Mr. Sweeney to give him an opportunity to explain why Apple should trust Epic this time and allow Epic Games Sweden AB to become an active developer. Mr. Sweeney’s response to that request was wholly insufficient and not credible.”\n\nThe letter also cites a February 26th X post from Sweeney and “a recent submission in the Australian litigation” and said Apple is concerned that Epic Games Sweden “does not intend to adhere to its contractual commitments to Apple and is in fact a vehicle to manipulate proceedings in other jurisdictions.” In a briefing with reporters, Epic’s vice president of public policy, Corie Wright, said Epic’s submission in Australian litigation amounted to it confirming its public plans to launch an app store in the EU as a result of the DMA.\n\nIn the briefing, Sweeney said that Epic received no communication from Apple between Schiller’s email and the letter from Apple’s lawyers and said that he’d have been willing to provide “any assurance they’d like” to abide by the contractual agreement. When asked whether Epic planned to abide by Apple’s developer terms despite Sweeney’s public criticism of its policies, Sweeney responded, “Yes, absolutely.”\n\nIn its blog post, Epic accused Apple of “taking out one of the largest potential competitors to the Apple App Store,” “undermining [its] ability to be a viable competitor,” and “showing other developers what happens when you try to compete with Apple or are critical of their unfair practices.”\n\nSweeney has been intensely critical of how the iPhone maker is implementing the changes to iOS under the DMA, calling them a “new instance of Malicious Compliance” and “hot garbage.” He said Apple is “forcing developers to choose between App Store exclusivity and the store terms, which will be illegal under DMA, or accept a new also-illegal anticompetitive scheme rife with new Junk Fees on downloads and new Apple taxes on payments they don’t process.”\n\nIn particular, Apple’s critics have objected to its plans to charge a 50 euro cent “Core Technology Fee” for each annual app install past the first 1 million downloads in the EU, which could quickly add up for larger developers.\n\nEpic’s blog post concludes by saying the developer plans to “continue to fight to bring true competition and choice to iOS devices in Europe and around the world.” Epic’s Wright confirmed that the company has made the European Commission aware of the fact that Apple has terminated its developer account. “Obvious non-compliance should be punished swiftly and speedily,” Sweeney said in a briefing.\n\nScreenshots of its three written exchanges with Apple shared by Epic Games can be found below:\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 4 An email sent from Epic’s Steve Allison to Apple’s Craig Federighi regarding its third-party app stores plans.

                        "publisher": "Rolling Stone",
                        "newstext": "I n early January, the hosts of Netflix’s feel-good series Queer Eye reunited for what might be the last time at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards. Through tears and smiles, Bobby Berk, Karamo Brown, Tan France, Antoni Porowski, and Jonathan Van Ness proudly raised their long-awaited golden statues.\n\nAfter six years, five cities, a stint in Japan, and connections with dozens of hometown “heroes” that the food, design, grooming, style, and culture experts helped make over, the quintet — known as the Fab Five — took home awards as producers in the Outstanding Structured Reality Program category. (They had been previously nominated as hosts, but this was the first season they were credited as producers.)\n\nThe moment was bittersweet. Last November, interior designer Berk stunned fans with news he was leaving the show. “It’s not been an easy decision to be at peace with, but a necessary one,” Berk explained in an Instagram post. “Although my journey with Queer Eye is over, my journey with you is not. You will be seeing more of me very soon.”\n\nThe timing seemed abrupt. Netflix was gearing up for a promotional rollout for the new season in late January, and future seasons were still up in the air. Even Brown balked at Berk’s announcement. “We are #ForeverTheFab5 no matter what,” he commented. “I’m about to be at Netflix’s door & e-mails telling them you can’t leave! Who is coming with me?”\n\nBerk was breaking up the beloved band, who had always publicly presented themselves as a familial, tight-knit unit. But after eight long seasons, 10 Queer Eye production members and well-placed sources tell Rolling Stone, that notion was beginning to shatter. Petty disputes and competition over who is considered the show’s top star were increasingly spilling out into the public. Even making the show was difficult, four production sources say, due, in part, to Van Ness’ behind-the-scenes behavior. Three more sources who worked with the reality star described Van Ness as emotionally “abusive” and having “rage issues.” Editor’s picks\n\nEventually the illusion of a happy family ended with Berk’s departure. Although Berk presented the decision to part ways as amicable, three sources with knowledge tell Rolling Stone there was more to Berk’s departure: Not only was he allegedly “blindsided” with how things played out, but talk has been circulating among those close to the show that another Fab Five member may have campaigned for Berk’s replacement. (Berk did not reply to multiple requests for comment.)\n\n“It’s not a new story that a boy band falls apart,” says one Queer Eye production member, who, like the others, requested anonymity, citing NDAs and career repercussions. “Essentially they were a group of people put together in their mid-thirties and told to be best friends. But people don’t expect that Queer Eye could be that. That’s truly what it was: a manufactured boy band with big personalities that certain ones were favored and certain ones were not, and then eventually [things] turned really toxic.”\n\nBobby Berk, Karamo Brown, Antoni Porowski, Tan France, and Jonathan Van Ness pose with their Creative Arts Emmys earlier this year. Frazer Harrison/Getty Images\n\nDavid Collins, the creator of the original series Queer Eye for the Straight Guy that aired on Bravo in the early 2000s, helped piece together the Fab Five after an international search. Producers whittled down hundreds of applicants to 40 and flew everyone to Los Angeles for final rounds. As the story goes, the chemistry within the group was instantaneous. “They all really hit it off, and they all really liked each other,” recalls one production source. “There was a reason why they were cast.”\n\nRelated\n\nApart from Brown — who appeared on The Real World: Philadelphia in 2004 — they were all relative newcomers to being onscreen. Van Ness was building a rising profile for their popular Funny or Die YouTube series Gay of Thrones. Berk had an established interior design business and home furnishings line. France headed up his own clothing company. And Porowski was the protégé to Chopped host Ted Allen (who was on the original Queer Eye as the food and wine expert).\n\nThe rebooted version followed the general beats of its predecessor, with each show centering acceptance as its main premise. Along the way, the makeover recipient — who may not personally know any queer people in their daily lives — forges a genuine connection with the Fab Five. It’s feel-good television, with silly laughs, misty-eyed scenes, and hopeful, teachable moments.\n\nThe original premiered in 2003 — more than a decade before gay marriage was legalized nationwide — and ran for five seasons. And despite being 15 years apart, Netflix’s Queer Eye came after the 2016 presidential election, which brought a fresh wave of divisiveness in the country. The Fab Five were tasked with stepping into a contentious climate to give people of varying backgrounds makeovers, while trying to form authentic emotional connections that didn’t come across as forced.\n\nAnd they exceeded expectations. Headlines and reviews from The New York Times, The Guardian, Buzzfeed, The Ringer, and others raved about its approach and the need for Queer Eye in the current political climate. “The Queer Eye reboot is even better than it should have been,” Rolling Stone wrote in 2018. “These Georgia boys are more than just makeover consultants: They are healers and sages for our time, not to mention sublimely bitchy quip machines.” Mia Fischer, associate professor of media studies at the University of Colorado Denver, says part of the success was Netflix bringing the show to a wider, global audience. The Fab Five’s diversity also helped the show feel more relatable for viewers, Fischer says.\n\n“I think the Fab Five are representing different nuances and ways to be within the LGBTQ+ umbrella … Jonathan being very open about coming out as nonbinary and also sharing experiences with how that sometimes feels really alienating and invisible even within queer spaces,” Fischer explains. “The show is having some real conversations: Karamo speaking about the complexity of Black queerness and Black masculinity … Tan sharing about his Muslim-Pakistani heritage and challenges with intercultural and interracial dating; Bobby being homeless because he had a non-accepting family and a non-accepting religious community. Those are all things that are very real to a lot of LGBTQ folks and really makes the show very relatable.”\n\n“Essentially they were a group of people put together in their mid-thirties and told to be best friends.” ‘Queer Eye’ production member\n\nThe friendship the Fab Five convey and their attempts to connect on personal levels with the “hero” is a crucial part of the show’s impact, Collins explained in 2018. “[The] show has shown that we’re able to talk to one another and have these dialogues, even from different sides of the equation,” he said.\n\n“The Fab Five are so effective at having some of these really difficult conversations,” Fischer adds. “They communicate to us that it’s really important not to stick in our echo chambers, but to try to bridge those differences and to have conversations with family members who might not be on the same page.”\n\nStill, says one production source, “My queer friends aren’t necessarily lining up to watch it, but [it’s] a show that a Southern mom with a gay kid — who’s kind of on the fence about whether to accept him — would watch and be affected by.”\n\nThe new show was a ratings success and one of Netflix’s early forays into original reality programming, paving the way for future hits Selling Sunset, Love Is Blind, and The Circle. It also catapulted each member into the public eye. “As a team, they blew up overnight,” says one early production source. “They were really trying to figure out how to navigate their own lives — their popularity as pop culture icons was definitely growing in size.”\n\nThey were beloved as a unit, but each was also focused on growing their own personal brand and securing their own various deals, leaning into their areas of expertise. Berk is the level-headed father figure with a solid design business. Brown is smooth, wise, and can quickly establish a genuine connection with the hero. France is English, chic, and quick-witted. Porowski is the quirky, foodie heartthrob. And Van Ness, who uses they/he/she pronouns, is beloved for their silly quips and joyous, over-the-top personality.\n\n“How is it not obvious to everybody that none of these people are friends? None of them. They don’t hang out socially. They live very different lives.” ‘Queer Eye’ production member\n\nAs Queer Eye got bigger, the quintet grew increasingly competitive over screen time and who had the best sound bites, production sources say, as each jockeyed to be the show’s biggest star. Still, it was clear hairstylist Van Ness was the breakout personality.\n\nThat, however, brought another set of issues. Four Queer Eye production sources and three sources who worked with Van Ness said the reality star was terrible to work with, using words like “monster,” “nightmare,” and “demeaning” to describe them. Three people labeled Van Ness as emotionally “abusive” and having “rage issues,” and all seven sources said the star would lash out at crew members and people who worked closely with Van Ness.\n\n“[There’s] a real emotion of fear around them when they get angry. It’s almost like a cartoon where it oozes out of them,” one source who worked with Van Ness explains. “It’s intense and scary.” During filming, one production source estimated that Van Ness would explode at least once a week. “He was a yeller,” they said. (Van Ness did not reply to multiple requests for comment.)\n\nIt’s a stark contrast to Van Ness’ public personality. While there is genuine connection between Van Ness and the heroes, six sources say, they also describe the star’s public persona as largely a charade. “Jonathan’s a person who contains multitudes and who has the capacity to be very warm, very charismatic, and has the capacity to make you feel really special that they are paying attention to you,” one source who worked with Van Ness explains. “But at least once a day, they would need to yell at somebody. It might be something small, but there’s always going to be somebody to point out and blame and make the villain of the day.”\n\nVan Ness’ behavior allegedly contributed to the rift within the Fab Five, with two sources saying it led to certain members of the group — including Berk — reluctant to shoot scenes with Van Ness. “There was absolutely tension between everybody else, especially from Jonathan Van Ness,” says one production member. “He didn’t want to ever share the spotlight with anyone. There were times when we couldn’t even shoot scenes with certain members of the Fab Five together because it got so bad.”\n\nJonathan Van Ness in Season Seven of ‘Queer Eye.’ Ilana Panich-Linsman/Netflix\n\nOther members could also be difficult at moments, but Van Ness stood out in terms of unprofessionalism, with his various moods dictating how the day would go, two sources say. “When he comes on set, everything changes if he’s in a bad mood,” one explains. “Working with him is very difficult in any capacity.”\n\nVan Ness’ alleged two-faced behavior was disappointing, a third production source says. “As much good as he wants to do in the world, I think a lot of it is very hypocritical,” they add. “There’s a definite contrast between the principles and the values that Jonathan stands for publicly,” another source who worked with Van Ness explains. “They’re really centered around having this warmth, love, and care for other people. There’s a real contrast between that and the way that they treat the people who are closest to them across the board. It’s the opposite of what this person is touted and paid to be.”\n\nNetflix executives had at least one meeting with Van Ness over her behavior and treatment of the crew, two sources with knowledge tell Rolling Stone. Yet it seemed to result in little change, sources claim. “The apparatus of [the show’s production company] ITV and Netflix promotes Jonathan and actively rewards them for their bad behavior,” one of those sources adds. “There’s no accountability at all,” a third person who has worked with Van Ness says. (Netflix declined to comment for this article.)\n\nBobby Berk in a Season Six episode of ‘Queer Eye.’ Ilana Panich-Linsman/Netflix\n\nBy the time Seasons Seven and Eight rolled around in summer 2022, the group’s dynamic was nothing more than a cordial working relationship, according to two production sources. Apart from Porowski and France — the only castmate invited to Porowski’s bachelor party last September — “none of them are friends,” says one source. “They play nice.” (Through a rep, France declined to comment for this article. Porowski and Brown did not reply to requests for comment.)\n\n“Their relationships have definitely changed since Season One,” explains a second Queer Eye production member. “As in all workplaces, as time moves on, people become closer with some people and move further away from others.” A third was far blunter: “How is it not obvious to everybody that none of these people are friends?” they say. “None of them. They don’t hang out socially. They live very different lives.”\n\nIn New Orleans, there was a feeling of consensus among cast and production that it might be everyone’s last season, according to three show sources. At that point, the show had raked in 10 Emmys, the Fab Five’s contracts were ending, and each member was juggling their own business ventures and side projects.\n\nThe most recent season was especially difficult: The schedule itself was intensive, filming from June to September with little downtime in humid temperatures. Crew members considered unionizing over alleged construction and safety issues due to rushed renovations, according to one show source. A rep for International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), the union for crewmembers working on theater, TV, and film productions, tells Rolling Stone that they “weren’t able to organize” the Queer Eye crew but confirmed members raised alarms about “worker safety concerns.”\n\nAnd there were serious safety issues after assailants carjacked a production vehicle, yanking a production assistant from a SUV and taking off in her car, according to show sources and The Hollywood Reporter. Filming was halted for two days, and ITV hired additional security after the Fab Five threatened to walk away from the shoot if everyone’s safety wasn’t prioritized. (A rep for ITV did not reply to a request for comment.)\n\nBerk also was butting heads with Van Ness and France during filming, sources say. All of the Fab Five’s work is essential to the hero’s transformation — and each relies on support from their departments — but it’s been a long-running joke among fans that Berk does the heavy lifting in the group, ripping down walls, building furniture, and renovating entire spaces on a tight four-day turnaround.\n\n“[There’s] a real emotion of fear around them when they get angry. It’s almost like a cartoon where it oozes out of them. It’s intense and scary.” Source who worked with Jonathan Van Ness\n\nBut while viewers see the other members having one-on-ones with the hero throughout the episode, producers routinely cut filmed scenes with Berk, according to four production sources. He would be absent for much of the episode, mainly appearing during the finished home’s grand reveal alongside his castmates. “I know Bobby did feel a bit less in the running [of being the fan favorite] because you didn’t see him that much in episodes,” says one production source.\n\nInitially, Berk himself was in on the joke. (As recently as last summer, he posted a video on Instagram making light of his scarce screen time.) But, according to show sources, the bit was beginning to wear thin. By New Orleans, two production sources claim that while Berk was friendly and professional, he seemed to be “checked out.”\n\nIt all seemed like the perfect time to wind the series down. “After New Orleans, everyone was like, ‘I think we’re gonna end it,’” one production source recalls. “It wasn’t a sad thing, but, ‘I think we left our impression.’”\n\nBerk also believed New Orleans would be the last stop for the Fab Five, recently telling Vanity Fair that the entire cast and crew had a tearful send-off. “We thought we were done,” he said. “Mentally and emotionally, I thought we all moved on. I know I did, and I started planning other things.”\n\nBut following the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes last summer, according to Berk, Netflix was left with a gap in its original programming and renewed Queer Eye in the fall. While the new contract would extend another four seasons, Berk told Vanity Fair he declined the offer, referencing the team’s ostensible goodbye in New Orleans. “All the plans that I had made when I thought we weren’t coming back, I just wasn’t willing to change those,” Berk said. “I would have had to pump the brakes on multiple other projects that are already in process. We had mentally just prepared ourselves to move on — that’s why I left.”\n\nBerk explained that he believed the others were also on the fence about not returning, and at the very least, all five would have to be in agreement to continue. “We’d just assumed that the show wouldn’t come back if we all didn’t come back,” Berk told Vanity Fair. “I was like, I’m not going to be having FOMO ’cause the show is not going to happen. I had become at peace with it.”\n\nThe Fab Five with “hero” Tim Keel in a Season Eight episode of ‘Queer Eye.’ Ilana Panich-Linsman/Netflix\n\nUnbeknownst to Berk, at some point castmate France — with alleged support from Porowski — campaigned to replace Berk with interior designer and friend Jeremiah Brent, three sources say, with one calling it “mean-girl antics.” (Netflix announced Brent as Berk’s replacement last Tuesday.)\n\nFrance appeared on Brent’s podcast last April, and Brent is also part of the Queer Eye extended family, previously co-hosting Say I Do — a short-lived Netflix show from the creators of Scout Productions, the company behind Queer Eye. (Neither Brent nor a rep for Scout replied to requests for comment.)\n\nFor some reason, Berk told Vanity Fair, the others ultimately changed course and renewed their contracts — leaving Berk the lone one out. “There were definitely emotions,” Berk said to the outlet. “But each one of us had our reasons why we did what we did. I can’t be mad — for a second I was.”\n\nMany production sources are surprised by the decision to keep Queer Eye going — even more so by the bulk of the group’s decision to return. Some speculate that despite the in-fighting and tensions, the other members agreed to return because Queer Eye serves as the main vehicle to keep their stardom afloat and support their separate ventures, some of which are floundering.\n\nFrance’s Next in Fashion competition show with co-host Gigi Hadid stalled after two seasons on Netflix, and he recently launched his own production company. Van Ness’ popular podcast Getting Curious was refitted into a docuseries on Netflix, which has gone dark after one season. The main backer for their JVN Haircare line went bankrupt, with the brand offloading at a stunningly low $1.25 million price. Brown’s syndicated talk show brings in around 600,000 viewers, and YouTube episodes fluctuate between 150K and 500K views on average. However, his little-known skincare brand MANTL has fewer than 10,000 followers on Instagram. And Porowski — who recently announced a new docuseries with National Geographic — saw his co-owned restaurant the Village Den in New York City shutter in 2021 after three years.\n\n“Of course they’re all still doing it to maintain popular culture relevance,” says one source. “They’re all basically influencers for their own brand.”\n\nWith Brent officially signed on, Netflix can move forward with Season Nine, which will send the new Fab Five to Las Vegas as casting for the new set of “heroes” is already underway.\n\nThose who worked on the show say that despite any feuding among the hosts, it shouldn’t take away from what the show means to viewers. The cast and crew believe in the show’s message, and the Fab Five’s intentions and interactions with the heroes are genuine, they say, despite any behind-the-scenes problems.\n\n“The experience that the Fab Five gives to the heroes … all that’s very real,” says one production source. “A lot of people — who believe in that message and care about it — work very hard and lose sleep to make a quality show that people care about.”",

Even Brown balked at Berk&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;We are <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/foreverthefab5/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">#ForeverTheFab5</a> no matter what,&#8221; he commented. &#8220;I&#8217;m about to be at Netflix&#8217;s door &amp; e-mails telling them you can&#8217;t leave!

But after eight long seasons, 10 Queer Eye production members and well-placed sources tell Rolling Stone, that notion was beginning to shatter. Petty disputes and competition over who is considered the show&#8217;s top star were increasingly spilling out into the public. Even making the show was difficult, four production sources say, due, in part, to Van Ness&#8217; behind-the-scenes behavior. Three more sources who worked with the reality star described Van Ness as emotionally &#8220;abusive&#8221; and having &#8220;rage issues.&#8221;\n\n\n<h2 id=\"section-heading\" class=\"c-heading larva  recirculation-modules-heading lrv-u-flex u-font-family-theme-primary lrv-u-font-size-20 lrv-u-color-brand-primary lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase u-letter-spacing-012 lrv-u-position-relative lrv-u-padding-b-025 lrv-u-padding-b-1@desktop-xl lrv-u-padding-b-075@mobile-max\">\n\n\t\n\t\tEditor&#8217;s picks\n\t\n\t</h2>\n\n\t\n\t<p class=\"u-flex@desktop-xl a-children-border-vertical@mobile-max a-children-border-horizontal@desktop-xl a-children-border-vertical@tablet a-children-padding-l-1@desktop-xl lrv-u-margin-b-00 lrv-u-padding-l-00\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\t\t\t</p>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   \">\n\tEventually the illusion of a happy family ended with Berk&#8217;s departure. Although Berk presented the decision to part ways as amicable, three sources with knowledge tell Rolling Stone there was more to Berk&#8217;s departure: Not only was he allegedly &#8220;blindsided&#8221; with how things played out, but talk has been circulating among those close to the show that another Fab Five member may have campaigned for Berk&#8217;s replacement. (Berk did not reply to multiple requests for comment.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   \">\n\t&#8220;It&#8217;s not a new story that a boy band falls apart,&#8221; says one Queer Eye production member, who, like the others, requested anonymity, citing NDAs and career repercussions. &#8220;Essentially they were a group of people put together in their mid-thirties and told to be best friends. But people don&#8217;t expect that Queer Eye could be that. That&#8217;s truly what it was: a manufactured boy band with big personalities that certain ones were favored and certain ones were not, and then eventually [things] turned really toxic.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n<img class=\"c-lazy-image__img lrv-u-background-color-grey-lightest lrv-u-width-100p lrv-u-display-block lrv-u-height-auto\" src=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif\" alt=\"\" height=\"683\" width=\"1024\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"lrv-u-font-size-16 lrv-u-font-size-14@mobile-max lrv-u-font-family-body u-font-style-italic lrv-u-color-grey-dark u-line-height-20 u-letter-spacing-0 u-line-height-18@mobile-max lrv-u-margin-r-025\">Bobby Berk, Karamo Brown, Antoni Porowski, Tan France, and Jonathan Van Ness pose with their Creative Arts Emmys earlier this year.</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrazer Harrison/Getty Images\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   \">\n\tDavid Collins, the creator of the original series Queer Eye for the Straight Guy that aired on Bravo in the early 2000s, helped piece together the Fab Five after an international search.

Van Ness was building a rising profile for their popular <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leM4RD6qqIQ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Funny or Die YouTube series Gay of Thrones</a>. Berk had an established interior design business and home furnishings line. France headed up his own clothing company. And Porowski was the prot&#233;g&#233; to Chopped host Ted Allen (who was on the original Queer Eye as the food and wine expert).</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   \">\n\tThe rebooted version followed the general beats of its predecessor, with each show centering acceptance as its main premise. Along the way, the makeover recipient &#8212; who may not personally know any queer people in their daily lives &#8212;&#160;forges a genuine connection with the Fab Five. It&#8217;s feel-good television, with silly laughs, misty-eyed scenes, and hopeful, teachable moments.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   \">\n\tThe original premiered in 2003 &#8212;&#160;more than a decade before gay marriage was legalized nationwide &#8212;&#160;and ran for five seasons. And despite being 15 years apart, Netflix&#8217;s Queer Eye came after the 2016 presidential election, which brought a fresh wave of divisiveness in the country. The Fab Five were tasked with stepping into a contentious climate to give people of varying backgrounds makeovers, while trying to form authentic emotional connections that didn&#8217;t come across as forced.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   \">\n\tAnd they exceeded expectations.

The Fab Five&#8217;s diversity also helped the show feel more relatable for viewers, Fischer says.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   \">\n\t&#8220;I think the Fab Five are representing different nuances and ways to be within the LGBTQ+ umbrella &#8230; Jonathan being very open about coming out as nonbinary and also sharing experiences with how that sometimes feels really alienating and invisible even within queer spaces,&#8221; Fischer explains. &#8220;The show is having some real conversations: Karamo speaking about the complexity of Black queerness and Black masculinity &#8230; Tan sharing about his Muslim-Pakistani heritage and challenges with intercultural and interracial dating; Bobby being homeless because he had a non-accepting family and a non-accepting religious community. Those are all things that are very real to a lot of LGBTQ folks and really makes the show very relatable.&#8221;&#160;&#160;\n\n\t</p><p id=\"gpt-dsk-tab-inbodyX-uid2\" class=\" adw-301 adh-250\">\n\t\t \n\t</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote larva // a-blockquote-type-pullquote a-triple-border-top lrv-u-position-relative u-width-85p u-width-75p@desktop-xl lrv-u-margin-lr-00 lrv-u-padding-tb-2@desktop-xl lrv-u-padding-tb-150 lrv-u-padding-b-125@mobile-max u-margin-t-275 lrv-a-font-primary-l   \">\n\t<p>&#8220;Essentially they were a group of people put together in their mid-thirties and told to be best friends.&#8221;</p>&#8216;Queer Eye&#8217; production member</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   \">\n\tThe friendship the Fab Five convey and their attempts to connect on personal levels with the &#8220;hero&#8221; is a crucial part of the show&#8217;s impact, Collins explained in 2018. &#8220;[The] show has shown that we&#8217;re able to talk to one another and have these dialogues, even from different sides of the equation,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   \">\n\t&#8220;The Fab Five are so effective at having some of these really difficult conversations,&#8221; Fischer adds. &#8220;They communicate to us that it&#8217;s really important not to stick in our echo chambers, but to try to bridge those differences and to have conversations with family members who might not be on the same page.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   \">\n\tStill, says one production source, &#8220;My queer friends aren&#8217;t necessarily lining up to watch it, but [it&#8217;s] a show that a Southern mom with a gay kid &#8212; who&#8217;s kind of on the fence about whether to accept him &#8212; would watch and be affected by.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   \">\n\tThe new show was a ratings success and one of Netflix&#8217;s early forays into original reality programming, paving the way for future hits Selling Sunset, Love Is Blind, and The Circle. It also catapulted each member into the public eye. &#8220;As a team, they blew up overnight,&#8221; says one early production source. &#8220;They were really trying to figure out how to navigate their own lives &#8212;&#160;their popularity as pop culture icons was definitely growing in size.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   \">\n\tThey were beloved as a unit, but each was also focused on growing their own personal brand and securing their own various deals, leaning into their areas of expertise. Berk is the level-headed father figure with a solid design business. Brown is smooth, wise, and can quickly establish a genuine connection with the hero. France is English, chic, and quick-witted. Porowski is the quirky, foodie heartthrob. And Van Ness, who uses they/he/she pronouns, is beloved for their silly quips and joyous, over-the-top personality.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"pullquote larva // a-blockquote-type-pullquote a-triple-border-top lrv-u-position-relative u-width-85p u-width-75p@desktop-xl lrv-u-margin-lr-00 lrv-u-padding-tb-2@desktop-xl lrv-u-padding-tb-150 lrv-u-padding-b-125@mobile-max u-margin-t-275 lrv-a-font-primary-l   \">\n\t<p>&#8220;How is it not obvious to everybody that none of these people are friends?

Still, it was clear hairstylist Van Ness was the breakout personality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   \">\n\tThat, however, brought another set of issues. Four Queer Eye production sources and three sources who worked with Van Ness said the reality star&#160;was terrible to work with, using words like &#8220;monster,&#8221; &#8220;nightmare,&#8221; and &#8220;demeaning&#8221; to describe them. Three people labeled Van Ness as emotionally &#8220;abusive&#8221; and having &#8220;rage issues,&#8221; and all seven sources said the star would lash out at crew members and people who worked closely with Van Ness.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   \">\n\t&#8220;[There&#8217;s] a real emotion of fear around them when they get angry. It&#8217;s almost like a cartoon where it oozes out of them,&#8221; one source who worked with Van Ness explains. &#8220;It&#8217;s intense and scary.&#8221; During filming, one production source estimated that Van Ness would explode at least once a week. &#8220;He was a yeller,&#8221; they said. (Van Ness did not reply to multiple requests for comment.)&#160;\n\n\t</p><p id=\"gpt-dsk-tab-inbodyX-uid3\" class=\" adw-301 adh-250\">\n\t\t \n\t</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   \">\n\tIt&#8217;s a stark contrast to Van Ness&#8217; public personality. While there is genuine connection between Van Ness and the heroes, six sources say, they also describe the star&#8217;s public persona as largely a charade. &#8220;Jonathan&#8217;s a person who contains multitudes and who has the capacity to be very warm, very charismatic, and has the capacity to make you feel really special that they are paying attention to you,&#8221; one source who worked with Van Ness explains. &#8220;But at least once a day, they would need to yell at somebody. It might be something small, but there&#8217;s always going to be somebody to point out and blame and make the villain of the day.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   \">\n\tVan Ness&#8217; behavior allegedly contributed to the rift within the Fab Five, with two sources saying it led to certain members of the group &#8212;&#160;including Berk &#8212;&#160;reluctant to shoot scenes with Van Ness. &#8220;There was absolutely tension between everybody else, especially from Jonathan Van Ness,&#8221; says one production member. &#8220;He didn&#8217;t want to ever share the spotlight with anyone.

There&#8217;s a real contrast between that and the way that they treat the people who are closest to them across the board.

At that point, the show had raked in 10 Emmys, the Fab Five&#8217;s contracts were ending, and each member was juggling their own business ventures and side projects.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   \">\n\tThe most recent season was especially difficult: The schedule itself was intensive, filming from June to September with little downtime in humid temperatures. Crew members considered unionizing over alleged construction and safety issues due to rushed renovations, according to one show source. A rep for International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), the union for crewmembers working on theater, TV, and film productions, tells Rolling Stone that they &#8220;weren&#8217;t able to organize&#8221; the Queer Eye crew but confirmed members raised alarms about &#8220;worker safety concerns.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   \">\n\tAnd there were serious safety issues after assailants carjacked a production vehicle, yanking a production assistant from a SUV and taking off in her car, according to show sources and <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/queer-eye-new-season-eight-new-orleans-crime-1235783725/\" target=\"_blank\">The Hollywood Reporter</a>.

He would be absent for much of the episode, mainly appearing during the finished home&#8217;s grand reveal alongside his castmates. &#8220;I know Bobby did feel a bit less in the running [of being the fan favorite] because you didn&#8217;t see him that much in episodes,&#8221; says one production source.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   \">\n\tInitially, Berk himself was in on the joke. (As recently as last summer, he posted a video on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CthqxYBLdkD/?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram making light of his scarce screen time</a>.) But, according to show sources, the bit was beginning to wear thin. By New Orleans, two production sources claim that while Berk was friendly and professional, he seemed to be &#8220;checked out.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   \">\n\tIt all seemed like the perfect time to wind the series down. &#8220;After New Orleans, everyone was like, &#8216;I think we&#8217;re gonna end it,&#8217;&#8221; one production source recalls. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t a sad thing, but, &#8216;I think we left our impression.&#8217;&#8221;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   \">\n\tBerk also believed New Orleans would be the last stop for the Fab Five, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/bobby-berk-leaving-queer-eye\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">recently telling Vanity Fair</a> that the entire cast and crew had a tearful send-off. &#8220;We thought we were done,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Mentally and emotionally, I thought we all moved on. I know I did, and I started planning other things.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   \">\n\tBut following the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes last summer, according to Berk, Netflix was left with a gap in its original programming and renewed Queer Eye in the fall. While the new contract would extend another four seasons, Berk told Vanity Fair he declined the offer, referencing the team&#8217;s ostensible goodbye in New Orleans. &#8220;All the plans that I had made when I thought we weren&#8217;t coming back, I just wasn&#8217;t willing to change those,&#8221; Berk said. &#8220;I would have had to pump the brakes on multiple other projects that are already in process. We had mentally just prepared ourselves to move on &#8212; that&#8217;s why I left.&#8221;&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   \">\n\tBerk explained that he believed the others were also on the fence about not returning, and at the very least, all five would have to be in agreement to continue. &#8220;We&#8217;d just assumed that the show wouldn&#8217;t come back if we all didn&#8217;t come back,&#8221; Berk told Vanity Fair. &#8220;I was like, I&#8217;m not going to be having FOMO &#8217;cause the show is not going to happen. I had become at peace with it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n<img class=\"c-lazy-image__img lrv-u-background-color-grey-lightest lrv-u-width-100p lrv-u-display-block lrv-u-height-auto\" src=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif\" alt=\"\" height=\"683\" width=\"1024\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"lrv-u-font-size-16 lrv-u-font-size-14@mobile-max lrv-u-font-family-body u-font-style-italic lrv-u-color-grey-dark u-line-height-20 u-letter-spacing-0 u-line-height-18@mobile-max lrv-u-margin-r-025\">The Fab Five with &#8220;hero&#8221; Tim Keel in a Season Eight episode of &#8216;Queer Eye.&#8217;</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIlana Panich-Linsman/Netflix\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   \">\n\tUnbeknownst to Berk, at some point castmate France &#8212;&#160;with alleged support from Porowski &#8212; campaigned to replace Berk with interior designer and friend Jeremiah Brent, three sources say, with one calling it &#8220;mean-girl antics.&#8221; (<a href=\"https://people.com/jeremiah-brent-queer-eye-bobby-berk-replacement-netflix-8406304\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix announced Brent as Berk&#8217;s replacement last Tuesday</a>.)\n\n\t</p><p id=\"gpt-dsk-tab-inbodyX-uid6\" class=\" adw-301 adh-250\">\n\t\t \n\t</p>\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   \">\n\tFrance appeared on Brent&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=6353802104641481\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">podcast</a> last April, and Brent is also part of the Queer Eye extended family, previously co-hosting Say I Do &#8212; a short-lived Netflix show from the creators of Scout Productions, the company behind Queer Eye.

Some speculate that despite the in-fighting and tensions, the other members agreed to return because Queer Eye serves as the main vehicle to keep their stardom afloat and support their separate ventures, some of which are floundering.&#160;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   \">\n\tFrance&#8217;s Next in Fashion competition show with co-host Gigi Hadid stalled after two seasons on Netflix, and he <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/tan-france-production-company-french-tuck-madison-wells-1235873707/\" target=\"_blank\">recently launched his own production company.</a> Van Ness&#8217; popular podcast Getting Curious was refitted into a docuseries on Netflix, which has gone dark after one season.

                        "newstext": "Since 2016, the “Fab Five” at the center of Netflix’s Queer Eye reboot have publicly presented themselves as a loving, tight-knit unit. But according to a new Rolling Stone report, there’s significant tension among the stars on set.\n\nRolling Stone spoke to 10 Queer Eye production members and “well-placed sources” who detailed what they say is the reality show’s tumultuous behind-the-scenes environment. One production member compared the Fab Five’s dynamic to “a boy band [that] falls apart,” noting that the five stars grew increasingly competitive over screen time and “jockeyed to be the show’s biggest star.”\n\nBack in November, Fab Five member and interior design pro Bobby Berk announced that he would be leaving Queer Eye after its eighth season. In a January interview with Vanity Fair, Berk said that he initially decided to leave the show because their contract was up, and he didn’t realize at the time that his four cast members ultimately decided to return.\n\nFour production sources told Rolling Stone that, despite Berk’s thorough renovation work each episode, producers routinely cut his filmed scenes, which meant he was absent for large parts of episodes.\n\n“I know Bobby did feel a bit less in the running [of being a fan-favorite] because you didn’t see him that much in episodes,” one production source noted to Rolling Stone.\n\n“Essentially, they were a group of people put together in their mid-thirties and told to be best friends,” the source said. “But people don’t expect that Queer Eye could be that. That’s truly what it was: a manufactured boy band with big personalities that certain ones were favored and certain ones were not, and then eventually [things] turned really toxic.”\n\nJonathan Van Ness’ on-set behavior was another allegedly contentious factor, with four production sources saying that making the show was difficult due to their actions. Three additional sources described the star as emotionally “abusive” and having “rage issues.”\n\n“Jonathan’s a person who contains multitudes and who has the capacity to be very warm, very charismatic and has the capacity to make you feel really special that they are paying attention to you,” one source who worked with Van Ness told Rolling Stone. “But at least once a day, they would need to yell at somebody. It might be something small, but there’s always going to be somebody to point out and blame and make the villain of the day.”",

One production member compared the Fab Five&#8217;s dynamic to &#8220;a boy band [that] falls apart,&#8221; noting that the five stars grew increasingly competitive over screen time and &#8220;jockeyed to be the show&#8217;s biggest star.&#8221;</p><p class=\"consumer-marketing-unit__slot consumer-marketing-unit__slot--article-mid-content consumer-marketing-unit__slot--in-content\"></p><p class=\"journey-unit\"></p><p>Back in November, Fab Five member and interior design pro Bobby Berk announced that <a href=\"https://www.them.us/story/bobby-berk-leaving-netflixs-queer-eye-after-season-8\">he would be leaving Queer Eye</a> after its eighth season. In a January interview with <a href=\"https://www.them.us/story/queer-eye-jeremiah-brent-we-finally-know-replace-bobby-berk-netflix-queer-eye\">Vanity Fair</a>, Berk said that he initially decided to leave the show because their contract was up, and he didn&#8217;t realize at the time that his four cast members ultimately decided to return.</p><p class=\"Container-bkChBi byNLHx\"></p><p>Four production sources told Rolling Stone that, despite Berk&#8217;s thorough renovation work each episode, producers routinely cut his filmed scenes, which meant he was absent for large parts of episodes.</p><p class=\"ad__slot ad__slot--in-content\"></p><p>&#8220;I know Bobby did feel a bit less in the running [of being a fan-favorite] because you didn&#8217;t see him that much in episodes,&#8221; one production source noted to Rolling Stone.</p><p class=\"inline-recirc-wrapper inline-recirc-observer-target-1 viewport-monitor-anchor\"></p><p>&#8220;Essentially, they were a group of people put together in their mid-thirties and told to be best friends,&#8221; the source said. &#8220;But people don&#8217;t expect that Queer Eye could be that. That&#8217;s truly what it was: a manufactured boy band with big personalities that certain ones were favored and certain ones were not, and then eventually [things] turned really toxic.&#8221;</p><p>Jonathan Van Ness&#8217; on-set behavior was another allegedly contentious factor, with four production sources saying that making the show was difficult due to their actions. Three additional sources described the star as emotionally &#8220;abusive&#8221; and having &#8220;rage issues.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Jonathan&#8217;s a person who contains multitudes and who has the capacity to be very warm, very charismatic and has the capacity to make you feel really special that they are paying attention to you,&#8221; one source who worked with Van Ness told Rolling Stone. &#8220;But at least once a day, they would need to yell at somebody. It might be something small, but there&#8217;s always going to be somebody to point out and blame and make the villain of the day.&#8221;</p></div>",

Allegations of emotional abuse and rage issues against Jonathan Van Ness have surfaced, while Bobby Berk's limited screen presence reportedly caused him to feel undervalued. The group's dynamic has been likened to a \"boy band\" that has become increasingly toxic, with one source claiming they were \"manufactured\" and favoritism was a factor."

                        "newstext": "A criminal case against a trio of collectors and auctioneers that drew widespread attention for the bounty they were accused of conspiring to sell — pages of handwritten lyrics penned by the 1970s rock band the Eagles, including the words to their legendary single “Hotel California” — ended suddenly on Wednesday when New York prosecutors dropped all charges against the defendants in an unexpected collapse.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney’s office in 2022 accused rock auctioneer Edward Kosinski, rare-book dealer Glenn Horowitz and former Rock & Roll Hall of Fame curator Craig Inciardi of acquiring pages of the Eagles’ manuscripts after they were stolen in the 1970s. Prosecutors accused Kosinski, Horowitz and Inciardi of conspiring to auction off the manuscripts, valued at more than $1 million, in 2016.\n\nBut the trial was upended over the weekend when attorneys for Eagles frontman Don Henley released about 6,000 of pages of documents mid-trial that defense attorneys said established perjury by several witnesses they had already cross-examined and tore a hole in the state’s prosecution. On Wednesday, prosecutors conceded that the defense had not been given time to review the vast disclosure of new evidence and moved to dismiss the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe drama was not lost on New York Supreme Court Justice Curtis Farber, who commended the district attorney’s office for “eating a slice of humble pie” while suggesting that it had failed to properly investigate the case before bringing charges.\n\nAttorneys for Kosinski, Horowitz and Inciardi — all of whom had pleaded not guilty — applauded the decision and said their clients should never have been charged.\n\n“We are glad the District Attorney’s office finally made the right decision and dismissed this case,” Jonathan Bach, an attorney for Horowitz, said in a statement to The Washington Post. “It should never have been brought.”\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney’s office declined to comment beyond its statements in court.\n\nDan Petrocelli, an attorney for Henley, said in a statement that the outcome was “unjust,” adding that his client will “pursue all his rights in the civil courts.”\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney’s office in 2022 alleged that Kosinski, Horowitz and Inciardi bought about 100 pages of the Eagles’ manuscripts — which featured handwritten notes and lyrics by Henley of songs from the band’s 1976 album “Hotel California,” including the title track, “Life in the Fast Lane,” and “New Kid in Town” — after they were stolen. Prosecutors accused the trio of working for years to prevent Henley from recovering the manuscripts and attempting to auction them for profit, and charged them with conspiracy and possessing or attempting to possess stolen property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAttorneys for the three men contended the trio’s innocence at the time. Intrigue followed as the case went to trial in late February, with Henley divulging details on the stand about his career and the origins of the Eagles’ most enduring song.\n\nArguments in the case centered on whether the manuscripts were stolen before Kosinski, Horowitz and Inciardi obtained them. Defense attorneys said Henley gave the pages willingly to an author hired to write a biography of the band, who then passed the pages onto Horowitz. Henley countered that they were initially given under a book contract that said the notes remained the Eagles’ property. The author has not been charged.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nDefense attorneys said Kosinski, Horowitz and Inciardi were never told about the contract, and they questioned why Henley’s attorneys never informed them about the contract and instead cast the theft as a burglary when they wrote in 2012 to the defendants to demand the return of the manuscripts, Bach said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe trial turned on its head Saturday, when defense attorneys suddenly received thousands of pages of previously undisclosed documents, including attorney-client communications, Bach said. They were belatedly released after Henley abruptly revoked his attorney-client privilege before the testimony of one of his attorneys. Henley had previously invoked his attorney-client privilege to withhold information when the defense cross-examined two other attorneys, before he changed tack.\n\nThat led to the sudden release of a slew of material that contradicted the testimony of the first two attorneys, said Stacey Richman, an attorney for Inciardi. She said the scenario was like something out of a crime drama.\n\n“Every time we turned a page, we were like, ‘What? Oh my God. This is revelatory,’” Richman said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBach said in court on Monday that the newly disclosed documents indicated that attorneys for Henley recognized that the contract was central to the case. The first two attorneys had testified that they didn’t think the contract was important when explaining why they did not cite it while demanding the return of the manuscripts, he said.\n\nBach argued that he and his colleagues were denied an opportunity to cross-examine previous witnesses over the reams of new material and motioned for a mistrial. The situation left attorneys for both parties stunned, he said.\n\n“All of the defense attorneys at the trial noted that it was unprecedented in their collective experience,” Bach told The Post, adding that the prosecutors had said the same.\n\nProsecutors initially contested the motion, but on Wednesday conceded that defense attorneys had not been given the opportunity to review the delayed disclosures and moved to dismiss the case, according to court transcripts. Farber, the judge on the case, concluded that Henley had used his attorney-client privilege to evade a thorough cross-examination and criticized the district attorney’s office for failing to thoroughly investigate the case before bringing charges.",

                        "newstext": "Manhattan prosecutors made the stunning decision Wednesday (March 6) to drop a criminal case against three men accused of trying to sell stolen notes linked to the Eagles’ 1976 album Hotel California, with a judge saying Don Henley had “manipulated” prosecutors.\n\nExplore See latest videos, charts and news Don Henley Eagles See latest videos, charts and news\n\nAt a hearing Wednesday, a New York judge dismissed the charges after prosecutors alerted him that newly uncovered evidence cast doubt on whether Henley’s notes had been stolen in the first place — the core defense advanced by Glenn Horowitz, Craig Inciardi and Edward Kosinski.\n\nThe disclosures came mid-way through a closely-watched criminal trial against the three men, in which Henley and longtime Eagles manger Irving Azoff had already testified. The proceedings had already run more than two weeks and had been expected to keep going until at least next week.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nThe sudden reversal was sparked by Henley producing new evidence that had been previously withheld under attorney-client privilege. The new materials touched on whether a journalist hired in the 1970s to write a book about the Eagles, Ed Sanders, had legitimately come into possession of Henley’s notes.\n\nAt a hearing in open court on Wednesday, Justice Curtis Farber sharply criticized Henley and Azoff’s conduct: “It is now clear that both witnesses and their lawyers … used the privilege to obfuscate and hide information that they believed would be damaging to their position that the lyric sheets were stolen.”\n\nThe judge said he was also troubled that prosecutors had been “manipulated” into bringing the charges, and questioned why they had not more thoroughly vetted the accusations and the evidence. But he praised them for dropping the case once new evidence had come to light.\n\n“Albeit late, I commend the prosecution for refusing to allow itself or the courts to be further manipulated for the benefit of anyone’s personal gain,” Farber said. “District Attorney Bragg and the prosecutorial team here, while eating a slice of humble pie, are displaying the highest level of integrity in moving to dismiss the charges. I am impressed.”\n\nIn a statement to Billboard following Wednesday’s hearing, Henley’s attorney Dan Petrocelli said: “The attorney-client privilege is a foundational guardrail in our justice system, and rarely, if ever, should you have to forsake it to prosecute or defend a case. As the victim in this case, Mr. Henley has once again been victimized by this unjust outcome. He will pursue all his rights in the civil courts.”\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney’s office declined to comment.\n\nHorowitz, a rare book dealer, Inciardi, a curator at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, and Kosinski, a memorabilia auctioneer, were all charged in 2022 with conspiracy over accusations that they tried to resell and hide the origin of the handwritten notes, penned by Henley during the creation of Hotel California. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin L. Bragg, Jr. said the trio had “made up stories about the origin of the documents and their right to possess them so they could turn a profit.”\n\nBut the three men always maintained that they had done nothing wrong. Their core argument: That the alleged “thief,” Sanders, had legally obtained them in the 1970s in the process of writing a never-released book about the Eagles. If the notes were never stolen, the three argued, how could they be charged with re-selling stolen property?\n\nThe trial kicked off last month, with Inciardi’s attorney telling the judge that prosecutors had “distorted the history” to charge innocent men and the DA’s office would be “apologizing at the end of this case.” Henley later testified that he had not willingly given away the notes, saying they were “something very personal, very private.”\n\nBut at Wednesday’s hearing, Justice Curtis said that Henley had recently handed over more than 6,000 new pages of emails and other disclosures that contained new information about how Sanders came to own the notes. Such “jarringly late disclosures” violated Horowitz, Inciardi and Kosinski’s constitutional rights, the judge said.\n\n“A review of these newly disclosed materials has demonstrated and highlighted Mr. Henley and Mr. Azoff’s use of the privilege to shield themselves from a thorough and complete cross-examination,” Justice Farber said at the hearing.\n\n“Accordingly, indictment 72426 of ’22 against each defendant, Glenn Horowitz, Craig Inciardi and Edward Kosinski is dismissed,” the judge said.\n\nIn a statement to Billboard, Horowitz’s attorney Jonathan Bach said: “We are glad the DA’s office made the right decision and finally dropped this case. It never should have been brought. Mr. Horowitz looks forward to carrying on with his important work.”\n\nAttorneys for the other two defendants did not return requests for comment.",

                        "newstext": "Weeks after Eagles rocker Don Henley took the stand in court, the criminal case centered on roughly 100 pages of his handwritten song lyrics — which he claimed had been stolen from him — has been dropped by prosecutors.\n\nThe case was abruptly dropped in the middle of trial in New York on Wednesday, thereby clearing rare books dealer Glenn Horowitz, former Rock & Roll Hall of Fame curator Craig Inciardi and rock memorabilia seller Edward Kosnski of charges, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe outlet reported that Judge Curtis Farber told the court that the case’s witnesses and their lawyers had “manipulated” prosecutors by using attorney-client privilege to purposefully hide information they thought would be damaging to their case. Those specific communications have not been publicly released.\n\n\"The attorney-client privilege is a foundational guardrail in our justice system, and rarely, if ever, should you have to forsake it to prosecute or defend a case,” Dan Petrocelli, Henley’s attorney, tells PEOPLE in a statement. “As the victim in this case, Mr. Henley has once again been victimized by this unjust outcome. He will pursue all his rights in the civil courts.\"\n\nThe case dates back to the late 1970s, when Henley and the Eagles began work with writer Ed Sanders on a band biography that never saw the light of day.\n\nDon Henley on Feb. 26, 2024 in court in New York City. YUKI IWAMURA/AFP via Getty\n\nHenley reportedly testified last month that while he may have given Sanders, who is not charged in the case, access to the lyric papers in order to help with the writing of the book, he “never gave” him permission to keep the pages, which contain handwritten words to classics like “Hotel California.”\n\nSanders sold the lyric pages to Horowitz in 2005, and he later sold them to Inciardi and Kosinski, who all pleaded not guilty to charges including criminally possessing stolen property, per the AP. Henley has said he was shocked to see the pages surface at auctions in 2012; that year, he bought back four pages for $8,500.\n\n“It just wasn’t something that was for public viewing.

(Photo by Carmen Mandato/USSF/Getty Images for USSF)\n\nThe U.S. women's national team beat Canada on penalties Wednesday night in a wild W Gold Cup semifinal that, by any reasonable measure, should not have been played.\n\nTorrential rain soaked Snapdragon Stadium in San Diego. Standing water covered the field, and turned the first half into a farce. The ball wouldn't roll. Passes couldn't travel more than 10 yards.\n\nOne of those passes, from Canada's Vanessa Gilles, gifted the USWNT an opening goal, and punctuated the absurdity. It hit a puddle at the top of the Canadian penalty box, and all but stopped on a dime. U.S. forward Jaedyn Shaw pounced.\n\nJAEDYN SHAW RIDING THE STORMMMM 🔥🤩 pic.twitter.com/0gq2tkR2sa — Attacking Third (@AttackingThird) March 7, 2024\n\nCanada equalized late in the second half. U.S. forward Sophia Smith answered in extra time. That, it seemed, was plenty of drama for one drenched night, enough narrative for even this rich regional rivalry. Smith dropped to her knees in relief, as if World Cup demons had been banished.\n\nBut then, in stoppage time of extra time, U.S. goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher punched and missed at a cross, colliding instead with Gilles. After a minutes-long video review, Canada was awarded a penalty, which Adriana Leon converted in the 127th minute to level the match at 2-2.\n\nIn the shootout, Naeher redeemed herself. She saved one Canadian penalty, then a second. She scored one of her own, then saved a third to seal a wild win.\n\nThe pressing question, though, for all 120-plus minutes, was why the game hadn't been delayed or called off in the first place.\n\n\"This is so insane,\" former USWNT star Julie Foudy wrote on X during the first half. \"STOP THE MATCH.\"\n\nWhen asked afterward whether it should've been played, USWNT coach Twila Kilgore said: \"Probably not.\"\n\nCanada coach Bev Priestman added: \"It’s obvious that the game was unplayable.\"\n\nThe referee, Katia Garcia, seemed to consider that possibility. After several minutes of slipping and sliding and splashing, Garcia paused the game, picked up the ball, and jogged over toward the sideline, where the fourth official and match commissioner were stationed. Garcia rolled the ball. It stopped cold on the drowning surface. Garcia held up her hands, as if to say: We're really going to do this?\n\nBut then she picked up the ball and instructed players to resume.\n\nSoon, they resorted to kicking and chasing, to middle school soccer, if that.\n\nConditions on the pitch are unplayable. Players trying to make the ref aware the ball can not be controlled.\n\n\n\nCan not see how the game continues right now. pic.twitter.com/tiF1uWPZp9 — SHE scores bangers (@SHEscoresbanger) March 7, 2024\n\nTrinity Rodman chased down a Canadian mistake, but overran the ball — because she couldn't push it through a likely inch-deep puddle.\n\nThis is just silly and probably dangerous honestly #USWNT pic.twitter.com/G0Tw6SWpCj — CJ Fogler account may or may not be notable (@cjzero) March 7, 2024\n\nLindsey Horan tried to play a long ball; she kicked standing water instead.\n\nAnd she was visibly frustrated. \"It’s not a day that you can play football,\" Horan later said. \"It’s really unfortunate.\"\n\nLindsey Horan tried to play a long ball.\n\n\n\nShe kicked water instead. pic.twitter.com/rXKcvAKiNY — Henry Bushnell (@HenryBushnell) March 7, 2024\n\nMost, if not all players got soaked, and spent stoppages trying to wring out their waterlogged, mud-splotched jerseys.\n\nNearly every single footstep brought rainwater splashing up into the fray, inhibiting anybody who tried to dribble.\n\nBoth teams completed less than half of their first-half passes.\n\n\"We put in a lot of work on the game plan, and then Minute 1, you throw it out the window,\" Priestman said.\n\nOnlookers, meanwhile, worried about the participants. San Diego Wave head coach Casey Stoney tweeted at tournament organizers: \"Player safety?????\"\n\n\"Call the game,\" former USWNT midfielder Lauren Holiday wrote on X. \"Don’t wait another minute.\"\n\nThe game, though, was never even suspended. It's unclear who, exactly, made the decision to play on, or what criteria they used to make the decision.\n\nA spokesman for Concacaf — the North and Central American soccer governing body, which runs the Gold Cup — told Yahoo Sports in a statement: “It is solely at the discretion of the referee as to whether the field is safe and playable.\"\n\nMultiple referees, however, explained that the decision is often made in conjunction with the match commissioner — or even by the match commissioner and other Concacaf officials.\n\nChristina Unkel, a former ref who worked at the highest levels of American and international soccer, said on the CBS Sports broadcast: \"Practically speaking ... that [decision] is almost out of our control when it comes to these types of competitions.\"\n\nRain seemed to relent at halftime. Stadium staffers wielding brooms rushed to push some of the standing water toward sidelines. The second half was slightly less farcical, though still extremely messy — and delayed for a few minutes by technical problems with the referee communication systems.\n\nIt was also relatively even, and in the 82nd minute, Canada got the equalizer it probably deserved. Jordyn Huitema overpowered Emily Fox at the back post. Her header left Naeher helpless.\n\nJORDYN HUITEMA WITH THE EQUALIZER 😱🇨🇦 pic.twitter.com/Yz628rXzXB — Attacking Third (@AttackingThird) March 7, 2024\n\nIn extra time, with the field somewhat less inundated, the U.S. recovered. Rose Lavelle flicked a header into the path of Smith, a fellow second-half substitute. Smith picked out the corner of the net.\n\nCanada's late penalty nullified it. But Naeher's shootout saves sent the USWNT to Sunday's final, where they'll meet Brazil (8:15 p.m. ET, Paramount+, ESPN Deportes).\n\nThey will remember Wednesday night with incredulity. They will bookmark it as a preposterous chapter in the rivalry.\n\nThey'll also have to forget it. They learned almost nothing tactically or technically — because, as CBS color analyst Lori Lindsey casually noted during extra time, \"not much soccer has been played.\"\n\nBut psychologically, it was significant.\n\n\"This is two big mentality games back to back,\" Kilgore said, referencing a resurgent quarterfinal win over Colombia. \"And that's a statement, regardless of how the game was played or how it ended up.\"",

(Photo by Carmen Mandato/USSF/Getty Images for USSF)<p>The U.S. women's national team beat Canada on penalties Wednesday night in a wild W Gold Cup semifinal that, by any reasonable measure, should not have been played.</p><p>Torrential rain soaked Snapdragon Stadium in San Diego. Standing water covered the field, and turned the first half into a farce. The ball wouldn't roll. Passes couldn't travel more than 10 yards.</p><p>One of those passes, from Canada's <a class=\"link \" href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/soccer/players/3906881/\">Vanessa Gilles</a>, gifted the <a class=\"link \" href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/soccer/teams/usa-women/\">USWNT</a> an opening goal, and punctuated the absurdity. It hit a puddle at the top of the Canadian penalty box, and all but stopped on a dime. U.S. forward Jaedyn Shaw pounced.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p class=\"caas-card-loader small fixed-height\"></p><p>JAEDYN SHAW RIDING THE STORMMMM &#128293;&#129321; <a href=\"https://t.co/0gq2tkR2sa\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link \">pic.twitter.com/0gq2tkR2sa</a></p><p>&#8212; Attacking Third (@AttackingThird) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AttackingThird/status/1765583240113336694?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link \">March 7, 2024</a></p></blockquote><p>Canada equalized late in the second half. U.S. forward <a class=\"link \" href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/soccer/players/2041334/\">Sophia Smith</a> answered in extra time. That, it seemed, was plenty of drama for one drenched night, enough narrative for even this rich regional rivalry. Smith dropped to her knees in relief, as if <a href=\"https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com/2024/03/01/smith-talks-uswnt-2023-world-cup-struggles-penalty-miss/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link \">World Cup demons</a> had been banished.</p><p>But then, in stoppage time of extra time, U.S. goalkeeper <a class=\"link \" href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/soccer/players/549963/\">Alyssa Naeher</a> punched and missed at a cross, colliding instead with Gilles. After a minutes-long video review, Canada was awarded a penalty, which <a class=\"link \" href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/soccer/players/549610/\">Adriana Leon</a> converted in the 127th minute to level the match at 2-2.</p><p>In the shootout, Naeher redeemed herself. She saved one Canadian penalty, then a second. She scored one of her own, then saved a third to seal a wild win.</p><p>The pressing question, though, for all 120-plus minutes, was why the game hadn't been delayed or called off in the first place.</p><p>\"This is so insane,\" former USWNT star Julie Foudy <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JulieFoudy/status/1765580670687134045\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link \">wrote on X</a> during the first half. \"STOP THE MATCH.\"</p><p>When asked afterward whether it should've been played, USWNT coach Twila Kilgore said: \"Probably not.\"</p><p>Canada coach Bev Priestman added: \"It&#8217;s obvious that the game was unplayable.\"</p><p>The referee, Katia Garcia, seemed to consider that possibility.

Garcia rolled the ball. It stopped cold on the drowning surface. Garcia held up her hands, as if to say: We're really going to do this?</p><p>But then she picked up the ball and instructed players to resume.</p><p>Soon, they resorted to kicking and chasing, to middle school soccer, if that.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p class=\"caas-card-loader small fixed-height\"></p><p>Conditions on the pitch are unplayable.

                        "summaryai": "Despite torrential rain and unplayable field conditions, the U.S. women's national team defeated Canada on penalties in the W Gold Cup semifinals. The match, which should not have been played due to the water-logged pitch, saw the USWNT score first on a Canadian mistake before Canada equalized late in the second half. In extra time, the U.S. regained the lead, but Canada scored a controversial penalty to force a shootout, where US goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher redeemed herself with three saves to secure the victory. However, the decision to play on despite the obvious hazards raised concerns about player safety and sparked questions about who ultimately made the call to proceed."

The instant death of Alabama’s season at that moment led to an emotional scene on the Alabama sideline. Heartbreak and frustration. Tears and adrenaline. And for Saban, he didn’t like how Alabama players conducted themselves in the aftermath, both on the field and in the locker room.\n\nSaban says the Rose Bowl loss wasn’t why he retired, but it sounds like some of the circumstances surrounding the loss did factor in.\n\n“I want to be clear that wasn’t the reason, but some of those events certainly contributed,” Saban told ESPN. “I was really disappointed in the way that the players acted after the game. You gotta win with class. You gotta lose with class. We had our opportunities to win the game and we didn’t do it, and then showing your ass and being frustrated and throwing helmets and doing that stuff ... that’s not who we are and what we’ve promoted in our program.”\n\nThere is nothing wrong with being frustrated and throwing a helmet in the heat of a moment. After all, this wasn’t an ordinary game. The Rose Bowl is nicknamed ‘the granddaddy of them all’, and it was a playoff edition of the storied bowl. A loss in the College Football Playoff is brutal enough, but what made it all the more devastating was the fact Alabama squandered a 20-13 lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter and then went on to lose in overtime. That’s a tough pill to swallow. Saban, who’s been known to yell at players and show them up on the sideline, should understand why players threw their helmets and why their frustration lingered on into the locker room. However, it seems like this is a roundabout way of Saban pointing blame instead.\n\nSaban went on to talk about how after the loss players were concerned about their playing time next season and how much money they can make via NIL. This dynamic, Saban claims, also factored into his retirement.\n\n“Maybe 70 or 80 percent of the players you talk to, all they want to know is two things: What assurances do I have that I’m going to play because they’re thinking about transferring, and how much are you going to pay me?” Saban said. “Our program here was always built on how much value can we create for your future and your personal development, academic success in graduating and developing an NFL career on the field.”\n\nSaban, once again, is pointing the finger at players as to why he retired. Although Saban is attempting to act holier than thou and as if money hasn’t always been at the forefront of star players coming to Alabama, that simply isn’t the case. Things have always been transactional in Alabama whether Saban wants to admit it or not. For example, last month former Heisman-winning QB Johnny Manziel, who went to Texas A&M, said multiple teams fielded offers for his services. Manziel named Alabama as one of the teams who did things in a shady way.\n\n“It’s the way the business worked back then. There was a bagman. There was a bagman at LSU. There was a bagman at ‘Bama,” Manziel said. “There was a bagman at every school around the country if you were competing for a national title.”\n\nSaban will go down as one of the greatest coaches of all time, but college football will be just fine without him. He retired right when the playing field was becoming more level due to NIL and the expansion of the College Football Playoff to 12 teams. The writing was on the wall, Saban knows it’s going to be much harder to consistently bring home championships as he once did. That’s why he retired, not because some players threw helmets after the Rose Bowl loss.",

We had our opportunities to win the game and we didn’t do it, and then showing your ass and being frustrated and throwing helmets and doing that stuff ... that’s not who we are and what we’ve promoted in our program.”\n\nThere is nothing wrong with being frustrated and throwing a helmet in the heat of a moment. After all, this wasn’t an ordinary game. The Rose Bowl is nicknamed ‘the granddaddy of them all’, and it was a playoff edition of the storied bowl. A loss in the College Football Playoff is brutal enough, but what made it all the more devastating was the fact Alabama squandered a 20-13 lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter and then went on to lose in overtime. That’s a tough pill to swallow. Saban, who’s been known to yell at players and show them up on the sideline, should understand why players threw their helmets and why their frustration lingered on into the locker room. However, it seems like this is a roundabout way of Saban pointing blame instead.\n\nSaban went on to talk about how after the loss players were concerned about their playing time next season and how much money they can make via NIL. This dynamic, Saban claims, also factored into his retirement.\n\n“Maybe 70 or 80 percent of the players you talk to, all they want to know is two things: What assurances do I have that I’m going to play because they’re thinking about transferring, and how much are you going to pay me?” Saban said. “Our program here was always built on how much value can we create for your future and your personal development, academic success in graduating and developing an NFL career on the field.”\n\nSaban, once again, is pointing the finger at players as to why he retired. Although Saban is attempting to act holier than thou and as if money hasn’t always been at the forefront of star players coming to Alabama, that simply isn’t the case. Things have always been transactional in Alabama whether Saban wants to admit it or not. For example, last month former Heisman-winning QB Johnny Manziel, who went to Texas A&M, said multiple teams fielded offers for his services. Manziel named Alabama as one of the teams who did things in a shady way.\n\n“It’s the way the business worked back then. There was a bagman. There was a bagman at LSU. There was a bagman at ‘Bama,” Manziel said. “There was a bagman at every school around the country if you were competing for a national title.”\n\nSaban will go down as one of the greatest coaches of all time, but college football will be just fine without him. He retired right when the playing field was becoming more level due to NIL and the expansion of the College Football Playoff to 12 teams. The writing was on the wall, Saban knows it’s going to be much harder to consistently bring home championships as he once did. That’s why he retired, not because some players threw helmets after the Rose Bowl loss.",

(4:28)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nTUSCALOOSA, Ala. -- The text messages on Greg Byrne's cellphone were pouring in, more than 1,000 and counting.\n\nLike most around the college football world, Alabama's athletic director was still processing what had transpired about 2½ hours earlier that afternoon.\n\nNick Saban had walked into the team meeting room at the Mal M. Moore Athletic Facility and told his players he was retiring. After 17 seasons, 206 wins, nine SEC championships and six national titles at Alabama, one of the greatest coaching runs in American sports history was over.\n\nAnd Byrne was on the clock.\n\nHe understood the enormity of what he was tasked with, the momentous challenge of hiring the replacement for a legend.\n\n\"When you're approaching a historic transition like that, you think about when Coach [Bear] Bryant retired, when John Wooden retired, but it's also different now because of the transfer portal and NIL,\" Byrne said. \"But from an impact on a university and the sport itself, it's as big a change as there has been in a long time.\"\n\nSaban spoke with his players for six minutes before leaving the room. Byrne then told the team he would have a new coach in place within 72 hours.\n\n\"It ended up being 49. I thought I would beat the 72-hour window but wanted to give myself some padding,\" Byrne said.\n\nSaban's meeting with his players ended at 5:06 p.m. ET on Jan. 10. At 6:06 p.m. ET on Jan. 12, Byrne posted a photo on social media with smoke rising from a chimney -- like the Vatican does when there's a new pope, except this time it was the chimney of a Tuscaloosa barbecue joint -- confirming that Washington's Kalen DeBoer was Saban's replacement.\n\nThrough conversations with the principals involved and other industry sources, ESPN retraced that head-spinning week, which ushered in a new era of Alabama football and, in some ways, reshaped the landscape of the entire sport.\n\nIllustration by ESPN\n\nBYRNE'S TWO-DAY WHIRLWIND was actually a year in the making. After the 2022 season, Saban informed Byrne he was nearing the end of his Hall of Fame coaching career.\n\n\"Greg, this is getting more and more difficult on me,\" Saban told Byrne. \"I'm not ready to do it now, but we're going to have to start evaluating this more on a year-to-year basis.\"\n\nWhile hopeful Saban would keep coaching, Byrne knew deep down that the 72-year-old legend was giving him notice, so he quickly went to work. Byrne had his staff research the college head-coaching hires over the past 25 years from the winningest 25 programs during that span.\n\n\"Part of what I was trying to understand is what were the analytics, and our studies showed that 75% of the time you're basically hiring a Group of 5 head coach, Power 5 coordinator or NFL coordinator,\" Byrne said. \"That's not necessarily a negative, but when it comes to the theory that you're going to hire just whoever you want, the percentages don't support that.\"\n\nThen again, this was Alabama, so the Tide could set their sights higher than most any other school.\n\nBy Bama's standards, the start of last season was a struggle, but Saban was exceedingly proud of how much the team improved. The Tide reeled off 11 straight wins, culminating with a 27-24 victory over Georgia in the SEC title game, snapping the two-time defending national champion Bulldogs' 29-game winning streak.\n\n\"We weren't a very good team those first few weeks of the season, but it's a credit to those kids how far they came,\" Saban said. \"I'm not sure I've had a team that improved more over the course of the season.\"\n\nBut Alabama's 27-20 overtime loss to Michigan in the CFP semifinal at the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1 was a hard one for Saban to digest. Not only was Saban upset about the way his team played, he was especially disheartened about some of the things that happened afterward -- in the Rose Bowl locker room and back on campus, when he met with some of the players.\n\n\"I want to be clear that wasn't the reason, but some of those events certainly contributed,\" Saban said of his decision to retire. \"I was really disappointed in the way that the players acted after the game. You gotta win with class. You gotta lose with class. We had our opportunities to win the game and we didn't do it, and then showing your ass and being frustrated and throwing helmets and doing that stuff ... that's not who we are and what we've promoted in our program.\"\n\nOnce back in Tuscaloosa, as Saban began meeting with players, it became even more apparent to him that his message wasn't resonating like it once did.\n\n\"I thought we could have a hell of a team next year, and then maybe 70 or 80 percent of the players you talk to, all they want to know is two things: What assurances do I have that I'm going to play because they're thinking about transferring, and how much are you going to pay me?\" Saban recounted. \"Our program here was always built on how much value can we create for your future and your personal development, academic success in graduating and developing an NFL career on the field.\n\n\"So I'm saying to myself, 'Maybe this doesn't work anymore, that the goals and aspirations are just different and that it's all about how much money can I make as a college player?' I'm not saying that's bad. I'm not saying it's wrong, I'm just saying that's never been what we were all about, and it's not why we had success through the years.\"\n\nSaban had also grown weary of churning through assistant coaches every year. For example, Tommy Rees, who was hired during the 2023 offseason, was Saban's seventh offensive coordinator in the past 11 years, and on occasion, there were nearly entire overhauls. After the 2018 season, seven assistants left for other jobs. Saban could tell that his age was becoming a factor in hiring coaches.\n\n\"People wanted assurances that I was going to be here for three or four years, and it became harder to make those assurances,\" Saban said. \"But the thing I loved about coaching the most was the relationships that you had with players, and those things didn't seem to have the same meaning as they once did.\"\n\nSaban and his wife, Terry, left for their home in Jupiter Island, Florida, on Thursday, Jan. 4, two days after flying back from Los Angeles. They always get away for several days right after the season, but this trip was different.\n\nIn addition to his age, Nick Saban said the changing nature of college football was a factor in his decision to retire. John David Mercer/USA TODAY Sports\n\n\"That's one of the reasons we went, to discuss whether I would keep coaching,\" Saban said. \"But she didn't know. I didn't really know. It's just not something I think about during the season, but that was the time to think about it and talk about it, for both of us.\"\n\nThey returned to Tuscaloosa the next Monday night, Jan. 8. During their time in Florida, there were some deep conversations but no final decision.\n\n\"I don't know if there's ever a good time to do it,\" Saban said. \"I felt like my age was starting to impact a lot of things. The older you get, the harder it is to sustain it at the level you want to and feel like you're doing a great job.\"\n\nWhile in Florida, Saban said he talked to Hall of Fame coach Bill Parcells, who has a home in that area. Saban said he also talked with former Alabama coach Gene Stallings about his decision.\n\n\"Both of them said you never know quite when it's the right time, but you kind of also know in the back of your mind when it's the right time,\" Saban said. \"And that's sort of the way I was feeling.\"\n\nStill wrestling with his decision, Saban called Byrne while he was in Florida and asked whether he would be in Tuscaloosa on Tuesday. Typically when they met, Byrne would drop by Saban's office because Saban was always so tied up with football-related duties. But this time, Saban went to see Byrne in his office. They talked for nearly an hour.\n\n\"I wasn't going to believe it until I heard it from him for sure, and he still didn't say it was for sure,\" Byrne said.\n\nBut Byrne knew where things seemed to be heading.\n\nOn Wednesday, Jan. 10, Saban was in his office at his regular time, around 7 a.m. Even staff members who had been with him the longest said it was business as usual.\n\n\"But that's just him. He was going to work right up until the very end, and that's what he did,\" said head athletic trainer Jeff Allen, who came to Alabama with Saban in 2007. \"It's a big part of why he's the best to ever do it, that singular focus.\"\n\nSaban met with people on his staff that Wednesday and conducted Zoom interviews with prospective assistant coaches. The gravity of what he was planning to do was surreal even for him.\n\n\"I'm sitting there looking at the clock, talking to Ms. Terry, and you know you've got a team meeting coming up. I guess I still wasn't 100 percent sure,\" Saban said. \"I thought it was the right time for us. I didn't like how it would impact the program, the players, the coaches, the people in the organization, the university. That part of it was really hard. But it was inevitable that it was going to happen at some point in time, and I didn't want to ride the program down.\n\n\"It was just the right time.\"\n\nAlabama athletic director Greg Byrne, right, zeroed in on Kalen DeBoer as a top candidate from the start. John David Mercer/USA TODAY Sports\n\nSABAN WAS ADAMANT that his players hear the news from him first, and he addressed them in the team meeting room. Byrne and members of the Alabama football staff also were present. There was an eerie hush as Saban exited the room, and Byrne then stepped to the podium and spoke to the players. He later met with the team's leadership group, then conducted an internal meeting with administrative staff members in his conference room.\n\nAs Byrne left campus Wednesday evening, he began reaching out to former players from different eras. He talked to Joe Namath, Mark Ingram, Jalen Hurts and DeVonta Smith.\n\n\"Not to discuss candidates, but it was more, 'What do you think if you were in my shoes?'\" Byrne said. \"Because they may have had a piece of information I hadn't thought about, which is good.\"\n\nEqually important, Byrne said, was the alignment at the university with president Stuart Bell and the board of trustees.\n\n\"We were all ready and all on the same page,\" Byrne said.\n\nFrom the outset, Washington's DeBoer and Florida State's Mike Norvell were at the top of Byrne's list. Both had what Byrne was looking for: a proven head coach who had won on a big stage and shown the propensity to develop players. Byrne declined to go into detail about whom he talked to first or his pecking order. But he had serious conversations with both coaches the day after Saban retired.\n\nThroughout the interview process, Byrne was in contact with Bell as well as with Saban and Mike Brock, the athletics committee chair of the board of trustees. Byrne had to deal with only one agent as Jimmy Sexton represents both DeBoer and Norvell.\n\nImmediately, there was speculation that Clemson's Dabo Swinney and Ole Miss' Lane Kiffin were possible candidates. Swinney played and coached at Alabama, and Kiffin worked at Alabama under Saban. Both were part of national championship teams at Alabama.\n\nByrne said there were conversations in his circle about a handful of candidates, but sources told ESPN that neither Swinney nor Kiffin was seriously in the mix. Texas' Steve Sarkisian, who, like Kiffin, is also represented by Sexton, was another prominent name mentioned in media reports, but Alabama's leadership knew Sarkisian wasn't going to leave Texas, especially with the Longhorns moving to the SEC next season, sources said.\n\nAs expected, Sarkisian sent out a social media post at 11:50 p.m. ET that Thursday saying it was a great day to be a Longhorn with a \"Horns up\" image. A day later, ESPN reported that Sarkisian was nearing a deal for a contract extension with Texas.\n\nOregon's Dan Lanning, who worked as a graduate assistant under Saban at Alabama, made it clear earlier Thursday that he wasn't a candidate despite erroneous reports that he had been spotted in Tuscaloosa. Lanning, also represented by Sexton, released a video at noon Thursday confirming that he was staying put after two seasons in Eugene.\n\nIt didn't really matter, though, because by that time Byrne was bearing down on his top two targets. He and his wife, Regina, met with DeBoer and his wife, Nicole, on Thursday in downtown Seattle. There were also serious discussions with Norvell that day.\n\nIn fact, in the wee hours of that Friday morning, the fear among Florida State officials was that Norvell was close to trading his FSU garnet for Alabama crimson. Sources told ESPN that Florida State was poised to move quickly if that happened and that Kiffin would be a prime candidate to replace Norvell.\n\nNorvell, who in his fourth season at FSU led the Seminoles to a 13-1 record and ACC championship, declined to say whether he was offered the Alabama job, but he acknowledged to ESPN later Friday afternoon that the previous 24 hours had been chaotic as he considered his options.\n\n\"You respect the place. You respect the position,\" Norvell said of Alabama. \"At the end of the day, it still comes down to the right fit. It still comes down to the place you want to be.\"\n\nThere were sighs of relief around FSU's campus when athletic director Michael Alford posted a tweet at 11:51 a.m. Friday that indicated a deal with Norvell was in place. Then at 12:07 p.m., Norvell took to social media to confirm he was staying put.\n\nShortly thereafter, news broke that Norvell had agreed to an extension on his contract that would pay him more than $10 million annually over the next eight years. Part of the agreement was a reassurance to Norvell that more money would be committed for his football administrative staff and a larger recruiting budget. A new stand-alone football complex was already under construction, along with upgrades to the stadium.\n\nKalen DeBoer wasn't going to turn down a chance to coach at Alabama. \"This place is not normal,\" he said. \"It's special.\" John David Mercer/USA TODAY Sports\n\nDeBOER'S EMOTIONS HAD run the gamut since the final seconds ticked off the clock at the national championship game in Houston. His Washington team fell one win short of a title, losing 34-13 to Michigan.\n\nAs the Huskies returned to Seattle the next morning, DeBoer said the last thing on his mind was that he might be on the verge of changing jobs. After all, it felt as if he was just starting his climb at Washington. The year before his 2022 arrival, the Huskies were 4-8.\n\n\"I mean, that Tuesday was hard,\" DeBoer said. \"We're flying back from the game, and you're just trying to get yourself back. I was texting kids on the plane just about how I felt about 'em, how strong I felt, especially the guys that were done with their careers. You're working through all of that.\"\n\nOn Wednesday morning, DeBoer woke up in the Pacific Northwest refreshed and ready to go.\n\n\"I was like, 'OK, quit feeling sorry for yourself and let's get up and let's go. We've got to go win this thing. There's another step here at Washington,'\" DeBoer told himself.\n\nLittle did he know that his world was about to change over the next 48 hours. Early that afternoon (West Coast time), DeBoer heard the news that Saban was retiring.\n\n\"It wasn't even on my radar, not sure it was on anybody's radar,\" DeBoer said. \"And then immediately when it happened, people from all over start calling and you're getting all these questions. I guess I knew with everything we'd accomplished that you might have some inquiries about jobs -- but not that one.\"\n\nLater Wednesday evening, DeBoer got the initial call that Alabama was interested in talking. He had never met Byrne, but Byrne had long been a fan of DeBoer's and the way he had won everywhere he'd been, including grinding his way through the NAIA ranks.\n\n\"It just happened so fast, all of it,\" DeBoer said. \"I get the call Wednesday night they want to talk. We're meeting on Thursday morning, and I was offered the job on Friday morning. I didn't have time to talk to a lot of people. I just knew I wanted the job.\"\n\nOne of the first questions Byrne asked DeBoer during their Thursday meeting was the inevitable: \"How do you respond to the narrative that you never want to be the one who follows a legend but rather the one that follows the one who follows the legend?\"\n\nDeBoer's response was exactly what Byrne wanted to hear.\n\n\"I'm going to embrace it,\" DeBoer said. \"There's only one person that's ever going to get to do that.\"\n\nWashington did its best to keep DeBoer, who rejected two contract offers from the Huskies. The first one came during the season, when DeBoer passed on an extension that would have taken him to a maximum of $9 million annually. The final rejection came that Thursday during Alabama's talks with DeBoer, when Washington offered a base salary of $9 million that would have maxed out at $9.6 million. DeBoer earned $4.2 million last fall. His buyout was $12 million.\n\nWhen DeBoer was offered the job Friday morning, one of the first calls he made was to Saban.\n\n\"I picked up the phone and reached out,\" DeBoer said. \"It was great, just, out of respect. I hope he knows how much it means to me to be coming in behind him.\"\n\nBy 2 p.m. ET Friday, Alabama was finalizing a deal with DeBoer. He told his players later that afternoon that he was taking the Alabama job before boarding a private jet bound for Tuscaloosa that evening.\n\n\"The hardest part is when you get put in that spot where the call does come, especially this one just because now you're a head coach,\" DeBoer said. \"You're not a coordinator going to a head-coaching job. You're not at a Group of 5 school where you're going from Fresno State to Washington. This was the toughest one of them all.\n\n\"We loved Washington, the people there, our players, everything we'd accomplished in two years. But I also just loved everything about Greg Byrne and our conversation together and everything that Alabama football stands for, the proud tradition of this program and how deep it runs.\"\n\nWhen DeBoer climbed off the jet in Tuscaloosa, fans were lining the fences at the airport to congratulate him. Later that evening, he met with the Alabama team for the first time.\n\n\"I hope you appreciate what you're a part of,\" DeBoer told the players. \"That's why I wanted to be here. This place is not normal. It's special.\"\n\nEven before his first day on campus was over, he knew the short-term challenges ahead were already piling up.\n\nKey players were entering the transfer portal or talking about it, and coaches were leaving. Two of the Tide's most promising young players left within a week of DeBoer's hiring, safety Caleb Downs to Ohio State and offensive tackle Kadyn Proctor to Iowa. There were also coaches coming and going, as DeBoer worked to assemble his staff and had to go through two waves of hiring assistants.\n\nOne of the things that was so heartening to DeBoer during that time was the way some of the pillars on Alabama's team -- Tyler Booker, Deontae Lawson, Malachi Moore and Jalen Milroe -- remained committed during all the changes.\n\n\"We've embraced the change and, as a group, want to finish what we started,\" Lawson told ESPN. \"We're not running from change. We're buying in and know we're in good hands. We have full trust in Coach DeBoer and the coaches he's bringing in.\"\n\nDeBoer understands how some would look at the sheer number of players leaving during that time -- 10 players entered the portal in the nine days after Saban's announcement, and more than 25 did over the course of the offseason -- and think Alabama's ship was taking on water. But he never viewed it that way.\n\n\"We had about 30 guys, and those are rough numbers, that have come into the program, and actually more than that when you count the guys coming in this summer,\" said DeBoer, adding that Alabama might add some players during the spring portal. \"There was some attrition that needed to happen, and some of it was happening before I even got this job.\"\n\nWith his first spring practice at Alabama opening earlier this week, DeBoer said he hasn't spent any time thinking about everything that led him to the Tide. He just knows he's here and ready to take on perhaps the biggest challenge any coach has ever faced in college football.\n\n\"I couldn't say no to that challenge,\" DeBoer said.",

Moore Athletic Facility and told his players he was retiring. After 17 seasons, 206 wins, nine SEC championships and six national titles at Alabama, one of the greatest coaching runs in American sports history was over.</p><p>And Byrne was on the clock.</p><p>He understood the enormity of what he was tasked with, the momentous challenge of hiring the replacement for a legend.</p><p>\"When you're approaching a historic transition like that, you think about when Coach [Bear] Bryant retired, when John Wooden retired, but it's also different now because of the transfer portal and NIL,\" Byrne said. \"But from an impact on a university and the sport itself, it's as big a change as there has been in a long time.\"</p><p>Saban spoke with his players for six minutes before leaving the room. Byrne then told the team he would have a new coach in place within 72 hours.</p><p>\"It ended up being 49. I thought I would beat the 72-hour window but wanted to give myself some padding,\" Byrne said.</p><p>Saban's meeting with his players ended at 5:06 p.m. ET on Jan. 10. At 6:06 p.m. ET on Jan. 12, Byrne posted <a href=\"https://x.com/Greg_Byrne/status/1745945476841537658?s=20\">a photo on social media</a> with smoke rising from a chimney -- like the Vatican does when there's a new pope, except this time it was the chimney of a Tuscaloosa barbecue joint -- confirming that Washington's Kalen DeBoer was Saban's replacement.</p><p>Through conversations with the principals involved and other industry sources, ESPN retraced that head-spinning week, which ushered in a new era of Alabama football and, in some ways, reshaped the landscape of the entire sport.</p><img class=\" lazyload lazyload\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\">Illustration by ESPN<p><strong>BYRNE'S TWO-DAY WHIRLWIND</strong> was actually a year in the making. After the 2022 season, Saban informed Byrne he was nearing the end of his Hall of Fame coaching career.</p><p>\"Greg, this is getting more and more difficult on me,\" Saban told Byrne. \"I'm not ready to do it now, but we're going to have to start evaluating this more on a year-to-year basis.\"</p><p>While hopeful Saban would keep coaching, Byrne knew deep down that the 72-year-old legend was giving him notice, so he quickly went to work. Byrne had his staff research the college head-coaching hires over the past 25 years from the winningest 25 programs during that span.</p><p>\"Part of what I was trying to understand is what were the analytics, and our studies showed that 75% of the time you're basically hiring a Group of 5 head coach, Power 5 coordinator or NFL coordinator,\" Byrne said. \"That's not necessarily a negative, but when it comes to the theory that you're going to hire just whoever you want, the percentages don't support that.\"</p><p>Then again, this was Alabama, so the Tide could set their sights higher than most any other school.</p><p>By Bama's standards, the start of last season was a struggle, but Saban was exceedingly proud of how much the team improved. The Tide reeled off 11 straight wins, culminating with a 27-24 victory over Georgia in the SEC title game, snapping the two-time defending national champion Bulldogs' 29-game winning streak.</p><p>\"We weren't a very good team those first few weeks of the season, but it's a credit to those kids how far they came,\" Saban said. \"I'm not sure I've had a team that improved more over the course of the season.\"</p><p>But Alabama's 27-20 overtime loss to Michigan in the CFP semifinal at the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1 was a hard one for Saban to digest. Not only was Saban upset about the way his team played, he was especially disheartened about some of the things that happened afterward -- in the Rose Bowl locker room and back on campus, when he met with some of the players.</p><p>\"I want to be clear that wasn't the reason, but some of those events certainly contributed,\" Saban said of his decision to retire. \"I was really disappointed in the way that the players acted after the game. You gotta win with class. You gotta lose with class. We had our opportunities to win the game and we didn't do it, and then showing your ass and being frustrated and throwing helmets and doing that stuff ... that's not who we are and what we've promoted in our program.\"</p><p>Once back in Tuscaloosa, as Saban began meeting with players, it became even more apparent to him that his message wasn't resonating like it once did.</p><p>\"I thought we could have a hell of a team next year, and then maybe 70 or 80 percent of the players you talk to, all they want to know is two things: What assurances do I have that I'm going to play because they're thinking about transferring, and how much are you going to pay me?\" Saban recounted. \"Our program here was always built on how much value can we create for your future and your personal development, academic success in graduating and developing an NFL career on the field.</p><p>\"So I'm saying to myself, 'Maybe this doesn't work anymore, that the goals and aspirations are just different and that it's all about how much money can I make as a college player?' I'm not saying that's bad. I'm not saying it's wrong, I'm just saying that's never been what we were all about, and it's not why we had success through the years.\"</p><p>Saban had also grown weary of churning through assistant coaches every year. For example, Tommy Rees, who was hired during the 2023 offseason, was Saban's seventh offensive coordinator in the past 11 years, and on occasion, there were nearly entire overhauls. After the 2018 season, seven assistants left for other jobs. Saban could tell that his age was becoming a factor in hiring coaches.</p><p>\"People wanted assurances that I was going to be here for three or four years, and it became harder to make those assurances,\" Saban said. \"But the thing I loved about coaching the most was the relationships that you had with players, and those things didn't seem to have the same meaning as they once did.\"</p><p>Saban and his wife, Terry, left for their home in Jupiter Island, Florida, on Thursday, Jan. 4, two days after flying back from Los Angeles. They always get away for several days right after the season, but this trip was different.</p><img class=\" lazyload lazyload\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\">In addition to his age, Nick Saban said the changing nature of college football was a factor in his decision to retire.&#160;John David Mercer/USA TODAY Sports<p>\"That's one of the reasons we went, to discuss whether I would keep coaching,\" Saban said. \"But she didn't know. I didn't really know. It's just not something I think about during the season, but that was the time to think about it and talk about it, for both of us.\"</p><p>They returned to Tuscaloosa the next Monday night, Jan. 8. During their time in Florida, there were some deep conversations but no final decision.</p><p>\"I don't know if there's ever a good time to do it,\" Saban said. \"I felt like my age was starting to impact a lot of things. The older you get, the harder it is to sustain it at the level you want to and feel like you're doing a great job.\"</p><p>While in Florida, Saban said he talked to Hall of Fame coach Bill Parcells, who has a home in that area. Saban said he also talked with former Alabama coach Gene Stallings about his decision.</p><p>\"Both of them said you never know quite when it's the right time, but you kind of also know in the back of your mind when it's the right time,\" Saban said. \"And that's sort of the way I was feeling.\"</p><p>Still wrestling with his decision, Saban called Byrne while he was in Florida and asked whether he would be in Tuscaloosa on Tuesday. Typically when they met, Byrne would drop by Saban's office because Saban was always so tied up with football-related duties. But this time, Saban went to see Byrne in his office. They talked for nearly an hour.</p><p>\"I wasn't going to believe it until I heard it from him for sure, and he still didn't say it was for sure,\" Byrne said.</p><p>But Byrne knew where things seemed to be heading.</p><p>On Wednesday, Jan. 10, Saban was in his office at his regular time, around 7 a.m. Even staff members who had been with him the longest said it was business as usual.</p><p>\"But that's just him. He was going to work right up until the very end, and that's what he did,\" said head athletic trainer Jeff Allen, who came to Alabama with Saban in 2007. \"It's a big part of why he's the best to ever do it, that singular focus.\"</p><p>Saban met with people on his staff that Wednesday and conducted Zoom interviews with prospective assistant coaches. The gravity of what he was planning to do was surreal even for him.</p><p>\"I'm sitting there looking at the clock, talking to Ms. Terry, and you know you've got a team meeting coming up. I guess I still wasn't 100 percent sure,\" Saban said. \"I thought it was the right time for us. I didn't like how it would impact the program, the players, the coaches, the people in the organization, the university. That part of it was really hard. But it was inevitable that it was going to happen at some point in time, and I didn't want to ride the program down.</p><p>\"It was just the right time.\"</p><img class=\" lazyload lazyload\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\">Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne, right, zeroed in on Kalen DeBoer as a top candidate from the start.&#160;John David Mercer/USA TODAY Sports<p><strong>SABAN WAS ADAMANT</strong> that his players hear the news from him first, and he addressed them in the team meeting room. Byrne and members of the Alabama football staff also were present. There was an eerie hush as Saban exited the room, and Byrne then stepped to the podium and spoke to the players. He later met with the team's leadership group, then conducted an internal meeting with administrative staff members in his conference room.</p><p>As Byrne left campus Wednesday evening, he began reaching out to former players from different eras. He talked to Joe Namath, Mark Ingram, Jalen Hurts and DeVonta Smith.</p><p>\"Not to discuss candidates, but it was more, 'What do you think if you were in my shoes?'\" Byrne said. \"Because they may have had a piece of information I hadn't thought about, which is good.\"</p><p>Equally important, Byrne said, was the alignment at the university with president Stuart Bell and the board of trustees.</p><p>\"We were all ready and all on the same page,\" Byrne said.</p><p>From the outset, Washington's DeBoer and Florida State's Mike Norvell were at the top of Byrne's list. Both had what Byrne was looking for: a proven head coach who had won on a big stage and shown the propensity to develop players. Byrne declined to go into detail about whom he talked to first or his pecking order. But he had serious conversations with both coaches the day after Saban retired.</p><p>Throughout the interview process, Byrne was in contact with Bell as well as with Saban and Mike Brock, the athletics committee chair of the board of trustees. Byrne had to deal with only one agent as Jimmy Sexton represents both DeBoer and Norvell.</p><p>Immediately, there was speculation that Clemson's Dabo Swinney and Ole Miss' Lane Kiffin were possible candidates. Swinney played and coached at Alabama, and Kiffin worked at Alabama under Saban. Both were part of national championship teams at Alabama.</p><p>Byrne said there were conversations in his circle about a handful of candidates, but sources told ESPN that neither Swinney nor Kiffin was seriously in the mix. Texas' Steve Sarkisian, who, like Kiffin, is also represented by Sexton, was another prominent name mentioned in media reports, but Alabama's leadership knew Sarkisian wasn't going to leave Texas, especially with the Longhorns moving to the SEC next season, sources said.</p><p>As expected, Sarkisian sent out a social media post at 11:50 p.m. ET that Thursday saying it was a great day to be a Longhorn with a \"Horns up\" image. A day later, ESPN reported that <a href=\"/college-football/story/_/id/39294235/fsu-novell-texas-sarkisian-staying-new-deals-works-both\">Sarkisian was nearing a deal</a> for a contract extension with Texas.</p><p>Oregon's Dan Lanning, who worked as a graduate assistant under Saban at Alabama, made it clear earlier Thursday that he wasn't a candidate despite erroneous reports that he had been spotted in Tuscaloosa. Lanning, also represented by Sexton, released a video at noon Thursday confirming that he was staying put after two seasons in Eugene.</p><p>It didn't really matter, though, because by that time Byrne was bearing down on his top two targets. He and his wife, Regina, met with DeBoer and his wife, Nicole, on Thursday in downtown Seattle. There were also serious discussions with Norvell that day.</p><p>In fact, in the wee hours of that Friday morning, the fear among Florida State officials was that Norvell was close to trading his FSU garnet for Alabama crimson. Sources told ESPN that Florida State was poised to move quickly if that happened and that Kiffin would be a prime candidate to replace Norvell.</p><p>Norvell, who in his fourth season at FSU led the Seminoles to a 13-1 record and ACC championship, declined to say whether he was offered the Alabama job, but <a href=\"/college-football/story/_/id/39295435/just-getting-started\">he acknowledged to ESPN</a> later Friday afternoon that the previous 24 hours had been chaotic as he considered his options.</p><p>\"You respect the place. You respect the position,\" Norvell said of Alabama. \"At the end of the day, it still comes down to the right fit. It still comes down to the place you want to be.\"</p><p>There were sighs of relief around FSU's campus when athletic director Michael Alford <a href=\"https://x.com/SeminoleAlford/status/1745850985816158655?s=20\">posted a tweet</a> at 11:51 a.m. Friday that indicated a deal with Norvell was in place. Then at 12:07 p.m., <a href=\"https://x.com/Coach_Norvell/status/1745854973261349108?s=20\">Norvell took to social media</a> to confirm he was staying put.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, news broke that Norvell had agreed to an extension on his contract that would pay him more than $10 million annually over the next eight years. Part of the agreement was a reassurance to Norvell that more money would be committed for his football administrative staff and a larger recruiting budget. A new stand-alone football complex was already under construction, along with upgrades to the stadium.</p><img class=\" lazyload lazyload\" height=\"320\" width=\"570\">Kalen DeBoer wasn't going to turn down a chance to coach at Alabama. \"This place is not normal,\" he said. \"It's special.\"&#160;John David Mercer/USA TODAY Sports<p><strong>DeBOER'S EMOTIONS HAD</strong> run the gamut since the final seconds ticked off the clock at the national championship game in Houston. His Washington team fell one win short of a title, losing 34-13 to Michigan.</p><p>As the Huskies returned to Seattle the next morning, DeBoer said the last thing on his mind was that he might be on the verge of changing jobs. After all, it felt as if he was just starting his climb at Washington. The year before his 2022 arrival, the Huskies were 4-8.</p><p>\"I mean, that Tuesday was hard,\" DeBoer said. \"We're flying back from the game, and you're just trying to get yourself back. I was texting kids on the plane just about how I felt about 'em, how strong I felt, especially the guys that were done with their careers. You're working through all of that.\"</p><p>On Wednesday morning, DeBoer woke up in the Pacific Northwest refreshed and ready to go.</p><p>\"I was like, 'OK, quit feeling sorry for yourself and let's get up and let's go. We've got to go win this thing. There's another step here at Washington,'\" DeBoer told himself.</p><p>Little did he know that his world was about to change over the next 48 hours. Early that afternoon (West Coast time), DeBoer heard the news that Saban was retiring.</p><p>\"It wasn't even on my radar, not sure it was on anybody's radar,\" DeBoer said. \"And then immediately when it happened, people from all over start calling and you're getting all these questions. I guess I knew with everything we'd accomplished that you might have some inquiries about jobs -- but not that one.\"</p><p>Later Wednesday evening, DeBoer got the initial call that Alabama was interested in talking. He had never met Byrne, but Byrne had long been a fan of DeBoer's and the way he had won everywhere he'd been, including grinding his way through the NAIA ranks.</p><p>\"It just happened so fast, all of it,\" DeBoer said. \"I get the call Wednesday night they want to talk. We're meeting on Thursday morning, and I was offered the job on Friday morning. I didn't have time to talk to a lot of people. I just knew I wanted the job.\"</p><p>One of the first questions Byrne asked DeBoer during their Thursday meeting was the inevitable: \"How do you respond to the narrative that you never want to be the one who follows a legend but rather the one that follows the one who follows the legend?\"</p><p>DeBoer's response was exactly what Byrne wanted to hear.</p><p>\"I'm going to embrace it,\" DeBoer said. \"There's only one person that's ever going to get to do that.\"</p><p>Washington did its best to keep DeBoer, who rejected two contract offers from the Huskies. The first one came during the season, when DeBoer passed on an extension that would have taken him to a maximum of $9 million annually. The final rejection came that Thursday during Alabama's talks with DeBoer, when Washington offered a base salary of $9 million that would have maxed out at $9.6 million. DeBoer earned $4.2 million last fall. His buyout was $12 million.</p><p>When DeBoer was offered the job Friday morning, one of the first calls he made was to Saban.</p><p>\"I picked up the phone and reached out,\" DeBoer said. \"It was great, just, out of respect. I hope he knows how much it means to me to be coming in behind him.\"</p><p>By 2 p.m. ET Friday, Alabama was finalizing a deal with DeBoer. He told his players later that afternoon that he was taking the Alabama job before boarding a private jet bound for Tuscaloosa that evening.</p><p>\"The hardest part is when you get put in that spot where the call does come, especially this one just because now you're a head coach,\" DeBoer said. \"You're not a coordinator going to a head-coaching job. You're not at a Group of 5 school where you're going from Fresno State to Washington. This was the toughest one of them all.</p><p>\"We loved Washington, the people there, our players, everything we'd accomplished in two years. But I also just loved everything about Greg Byrne and our conversation together and everything that Alabama football stands for, the proud tradition of this program and how deep it runs.\"</p><p>When DeBoer climbed off the jet in Tuscaloosa, fans were lining the fences at the airport to congratulate him. Later that evening, he met with the Alabama team for the first time.</p><p>\"I hope you appreciate what you're a part of,\" DeBoer told the players. \"That's why I wanted to be here. This place is not normal. It's special.\"</p><p>Even before his first day on campus was over, he knew the short-term challenges ahead were already piling up.</p><p>Key players were entering the transfer portal or talking about it, and coaches were leaving. Two of the Tide's most promising young players left within a week of DeBoer's hiring, safety <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4870706/caleb-downs\">Caleb Downs</a> to Ohio State and offensive tackle <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4870976/kadyn-proctor\">Kadyn Proctor</a> to Iowa. There were also coaches coming and going, as DeBoer worked to assemble his staff and had to go through two waves of hiring assistants.</p><p>One of the things that was so heartening to DeBoer during that time was the way some of the pillars on Alabama's team -- <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4685263/tyler-booker\">Tyler Booker</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4432725/deontae-lawson\">Deontae Lawson</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4692024/malachi-moore\">Malachi Moore</a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4432734/jalen-milroe\">Jalen Milroe</a> -- remained committed during all the changes.</p><p>\"We've embraced the change and, as a group, want to finish what we started,\" <a href=\"/college-football/story/_/id/39331740/alabama-players-not-running-change-eager-kalen-deboer-era\">Lawson told ESPN</a>. \"We're not running from change. We're buying in and know we're in good hands. We have full trust in Coach DeBoer and the coaches he's bringing in.\"</p><p>DeBoer understands how some would look at the sheer number of players leaving during that time -- 10 players entered the portal in the nine days after Saban's announcement, and more than 25 did over the course of the offseason -- and think Alabama's ship was taking on water. But he never viewed it that way.</p><p class=\"ad-slot ad-slot-incontent2 ad-wrapper\"></p><p>\"We had about 30 guys, and those are rough numbers, that have come into the program, and actually more than that when you count the guys coming in this summer,\" said DeBoer, adding that Alabama might add some players during the spring portal. \"There was some attrition that needed to happen, and some of it was happening before I even got this job.\"</p><p>With his first spring practice at Alabama opening earlier this week, DeBoer said he hasn't spent any time thinking about everything that led him to the Tide. He just knows he's here and ready to take on perhaps the biggest challenge any coach has ever faced in college football.</p><p>\"I couldn't say no to that challenge,\" DeBoer said.</p>\n</div>",

Saban noted a shift in players' priorities towards financial gain and a lack of adherence to the team's principles of winning and losing with class. He questioned the effectiveness of his messaging and expressed concern that the program's goals no longer aligned with his vision for player development and future success. Saban's departure marks the end of an era, as he leaves behind a legacy of seven national championships and a lasting impact on college football."

                        "newstext": "Nick Saban was not thrilled with the way his team reacted to losing the Rose Bowl.\n\nAlabama lost 27-20 to eventual national champion Michigan in the College Football Playoff on Jan. 1. The overtime loss came after Jalen Milroe’s fourth-down run was stopped at the line of scrimmage. Milroe took off toward the end zone after a low snap on what appeared to be a designed run/pass option.\n\nThe game turned out to be the final one of Saban’s career as he shocked the college football world by announcing his retirement less than two weeks later. In a story recounting his decision-making process to retire and Alabama’s ensuing coaching search, Saban told ESPN the way some players on his team acted immediately after the loss and in the ensuing days “contributed” to his decision to hang it up after the 2023 season.\n\nFrom ESPN:\n\n\"I want to be clear that wasn't the reason, but some of those events certainly contributed,\" Saban said of his decision to retire. \"I was really disappointed in the way that the players acted after the game. You gotta win with class. You gotta lose with class. We had our opportunities to win the game and we didn't do it, and then showing your ass and being frustrated and throwing helmets and doing that stuff ... that's not who we are and what we've promoted in our program.\"\n\nSaban also talked about how the way the college football landscape is changing influenced his decision. He estimated that \"maybe 70 or 80% of the players you talk to\" wanted to know about their playing time for the upcoming season and how much they would be making in NIL money.\n\nSaban retired as the most successful coach in modern college football history. His teams won seven national titles — including six at Alabama — and he turned the Crimson Tide into a machine in the College Football Playoff era. Over the 10 years of the four-team playoff, Alabama made the postseason eight times. No other team made it more than six times.\n\nSaban’s retirement was not a spur of the moment decision, however. He had been thinking about the end of his career for a bit. Saban told Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne at the end of the 2022 season that retirement was getting closer and closer.\n\n\"Greg, this is getting more and more difficult on me,\" Saban told Byrne. \"I'm not ready to do it now, but we're going to have to start evaluating this more on a year-to-year basis.\"\n\nAlabama moved quickly to secure Saban’s replacement after his retirement. The Crimson Tide hired former Washington coach Kalen DeBoer to succeed Saban after DeBoer led Washington to its second playoff appearance and its first CFP national title game. Saban’s retirement was part of a busy college football offseason that included Michigan’s Jim Harbaugh heading to the NFL and UCLA’s Chip Kelly heading to Ohio State to become the Buckeyes’ offensive coordinator.\n\nSaban, meanwhile, will still have a significant presence in college football. He's set to be an analyst for ESPN in 2024 after serving as a guest analyst in recent years when his schedule allowed.",

                "newstext": "WASHINGTON — SpaceX is planning a more ambitious set of in-flight tests of its Starship vehicle on its next launch to demonstrate capabilities needed for launching satellites and going to the moon.\n\nSpaceX said March 6 it was projecting a launch of Starship/Super Heavy vehicle on its third integrated test flight as soon as March 14. The company noted that date is pending regulatory approvals, although officials with the Federal Aviation Administration, which closed Feb. 26 the investigation into the second flight, said last month they expected to have an updated license ready in time to support a mid-March launch.\n\nThe third flight will follow a different profile than the first two, which called for Starship to complete nearly one orbit before reentering and splashing down near Hawaii about 90 minutes after liftoff from the company’s Starbase complex in South Texas. Neither launch completed that profile, with the first Starship/Super Heavy vehicle destroyed a few minutes after liftoff in April 2023 and the second, in November 2023, suffering separate failures of the Super Heavy booster and Starship upper stage.\n\nThe profile for the third flight projects a splashdown in the Indian Ocean nearly 65 minutes after liftoff. “This new flight path enables us to attempt new techniques like in-space engine burns while maximizing public safety,” the company stated.\n\nA firing of a Raptor engine while in space, which SpaceX has not attempted, is one of the new elements added to the upcoming launch. Another in-flight test added to the mission is opening and closing a payload bay door that would be used for future launches that deploy Starlink satellites.\n\nSpaceX also confirmed it will perform a propellant transfer test on the flight, moving propellant from one tank to another within Starship. That test, supported by a NASA Tipping Point technology demonstration award, is a step towards future tests where one Starship vehicle will transfer methane and liquid oxygen propellants to another Starship in orbit.\n\nThat capability is essential to Starship’s use as a lunar lander for NASA’s Human Landing System (HLS) program. One Starship would serve as a propellant depot in low Earth orbit, filled by subsequent flights of “tanker” Starships. The Starship lunar lander would then launch, be refueled by the depot, and go to the moon. A SpaceX official said in January that “ten-ish” refueling flights would be needed to support a single HLS mission.\n\nThe pace of Starship development to support the first crewed Artemis landing, no earlier than September 2026, has been a source of tension. “Of course it absolutely concerns me because we need them to launch multiple times,” Jim Free, NASA associate administrator, said in an interview broadcast by the CBS News program “60 Minutes” March 3, when asked about the first two Starship launches.\n\nHowever, he said he still believed the landing could take place on the current schedule, even after told of an interview SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk gave in January where Musk said a human landing on the moon would take place “in less than five years,” which would suggest a potential delay of up to two years.\n\n“My view of that,” Free said, “is that we have a contract with SpaceX that says they’re going to launch our crew in the end of 2026.”\n\nNASA’s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, which highlighted the complexities of the Artemis 3 mission in its annual report published in January, said at its Feb. 28 public meeting that NASA and SpaceX were working well together on the HLS version of Starship.\n\n“What we heard from the team this time was that there’s a lot of good learning going on with the flight tests of Starship,” said William Bray, a member of the panel. “There’s goodness there between SpaceX and the NASA teams as we evolve forward.”",

We've reported on this before, but it's worth reinforcing that no launch provider, commercial or government, has ever operated at this cadence.\n\nSpaceX has previously had rockets on all four of its active launch pads. But what SpaceX accomplished over a 24-hour period was noteworthy. Engineers inside at least four control centers were actively overseeing spacecraft and rocket operations simultaneously.\n\nThe sprawl of SpaceX\n\nOn Sunday night at the Starbase facility in South Texas, teams loaded more than 10 million pounds of methane and liquid oxygen propellants into the nearly 400-foot-tall (121-meter) Starship rocket slated to lift off as soon as this month on the third full-scale test flight of SpaceX's next-generation launcher.\n\nThis was likely the final major test before SpaceX launches the third Starship test flight. The countdown rehearsal of the fully stacked rocket ended as planned at T-minus 10 seconds, just before the booster's Raptor engines were ignited; SpaceX then drained the vehicle of propellant. SpaceX previously test-fired the Super Heavy booster and Starship upper stage separately.\n\nThe schedule for the next Starship launch hinges on approval from the Federal Aviation Administration, which is reviewing SpaceX's actions to correct the malfunctions that occurred on the second Starship test flight in November. Last week, the FAA announced it closed its investigation into the second Starship test flight, which was largely successful in demonstrating significant progress on SpaceX's privately funded rocket program. But the test flight ended with explosions of the Super Heavy booster and Starship upper stage, prompting an FAA investigation.\n\nOn the next Starship flight, SpaceX wants to perform some early-stage testing of the in-space refueling technology it will need for later Starship flights, such as missions to the Moon for NASA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the same time that SpaceX's team in Texas managed the Starship countdown rehearsal, another group of engineers and technicians on Florida's Space Coast stepped through a Falcon 9 launch countdown Sunday night. Three NASA astronauts and one Russian cosmonaut strapped into their seats on SpaceX's Crew Dragon Endeavour spacecraft on top of the Falcon 9 rocket, then waited for liftoff from Launch Complex 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center at 10:53 pm EST Sunday (03:53 UTC Monday).\n\nThe Falcon 9 launch of NASA's Crew-8 mission Sunday night was the first of three Falcon 9 launches over the next 20 hours. Next in line was a launch at 5:05 pm EST (2205 UTC) Monday from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California with 53 small payloads on SpaceX's 10th Transporter rideshare mission. The customer payloads on this Falcon 9 launch included MethaneSAT, an $88 million satellite funded primarily by philanthropic donations to monitor methane greenhouse gas emissions around the world.\n\nThen, less than two hours later, at 6:56 pm EST (2356 UTC), a Falcon 9 rocket took off from SpaceX's most active launch pad at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. This mission delivered 23 more Starlink broadband satellites into orbit for SpaceX's commercial Internet network. At 1 hour and 51 minutes, this was the shortest time separation to date between two SpaceX launches.\n\nAll three Falcon 9 launches ended with landings of the rockets' first-stage boosters.\n\nWhile controllers at Starbase, Cape Canaveral, and Vandenberg looked after these three Falcon 9 launches, SpaceX engineers at the company's headquarters near Los Angeles tracked the performance and progress of the Crew Dragon Endeavour spacecraft on its way to the International Space Station, where it docked early Tuesday. Next week, another SpaceX capsule, Crew Dragon Endurance, will depart the station to bring a different four-person crew back to Earth.\n\nSpaceX, which now has more than 13,000 employees, pulled off a similar rapid-fire launch cadence in mid-February with three Falcon 9 launches in approximately 23 hours, but this time included the additional complexity of operating a Dragon crew capsule en route to the ISS, plus the Starship countdown in Texas. While all this was going on, a handful of ground controllers also monitored the health of the Dragon spacecraft currently docked at the space station.",

                        "publisher": "Spaceflight Now",
                        "newstext": "SpaceX may be on the cusp of launching its massive Starship rocket for a third time, potentially as early as next Thursday. In an online update, the company said it is targeting Thursday, March 14 for the third flight test of Starship “pending regulatory approval.”\n\nWhile SpaceX didn’t publish a launch time on its website, a livestream post on X (formerly Twitter) showed a start time of 7:30 am EST (6:30 a.m. CST, 1230 UTC). Coupled with SpaceX stating that its broadcast would begin about 30 minutes prior to liftoff, that suggests a target launch time of 8:00 a.m. EST (7:00: a.m. CST, 1300 UTC).\n\nThe mission continues SpaceX’s iterative approach to developing its Starship rocket, which involves flying as much as possible and getting through as much of its mission profile as it can. SpaceX is hoping to push a number of boundaries for the vehicle with this flight.\n\nOn the Ship 28 upper stage for instance, SpaceX aims to test the payload door, conduct a re-ignition of one or more Raptor engines while in space and conduct a propellant transfer demonstration during the coast phase.\n\nBeing able to demonstrate propellant transfer in space is key not only to SpaceX’s future ambitions, but also to NASA’s Artemis program. While this flight will perform the transfer within Ship 28, the next big leap will be a ship-to-ship transfer.\n\nSpaceX will need to launch several Starships in order to fuel a tanker on orbit. That tanker will then be used to shift that propellant to the Human Landing System program’s version of Starship, which will carry astronauts down to the surface of the Moon and back up again.\n\nIn February, NASA and SpaceX were busily testing docking mechanisms that will allow its Orion spacecraft to dock with the HLS Starship while in lunar orbit. They performed the work at NASA’s Marshall Spaceflight Center, the NASA installation where the HLS program is based.\n\nWhile this third flight test won’t include a payload, SpaceX needs to reach orbit to achieve its stated goals. During a company talk given earlier this year at Starbase in southern Texas, SpaceX founder Elon Musk explained why they believe Starship failed to reach orbit during its second flight test.\n\n“Flight 2 almost actually made it to orbit. In fact, ironically, if had had a payload it would’ve made it to orbit,” said SpaceX founder Elon Musk during a company talk earlier this year. “The reason that it didn’t quite make it to orbit was because we vented the liquid oxygen and the liquid oxygen ultimately led to fire and an explosion.”\n\n“We wanted to vent the liquid oxygen because we normally wouldn’t have that liquid oxygen if we had a payload.

It pointed to one of the 33 Raptor engines on the Super Heavy booster that “failed energetically” during the 13-engine boostback burn, which caused the vehicle to explode roughly 3.5 minutes into flight.\n\n“The most likely root cause for the booster [rapid unscheduled disassembly] was determined to be filter blockage where liquid oxygen is supplied to the engines, leading to a loss of inlet pressure in engine oxidizer turbo pumps that eventually resulted in one engine failing in a way that resulted in the loss of the vehicle,” SpaceX stated. “SpaceX has since implemented hardware changes inside future booster oxidizer tanks to improve propellant filtration capabilities and refined operations to increase reliability.”\n\nAddressing this was part of the 17 action items established through the SpaceX-led mishap investigation following OFT-2. On Feb. 26, the same day SpaceX published its blog post, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) notified the public that it closed the mishap investigation.\n\nIt outlined seven corrective actions needed for the Super Heavy Booster and ten for the Starship upper stage. As part of those actions, SpaceX noted that it would introduce “new electronic Thrust Vector Control system for Starship’s upper stage Raptor engines and [improve] the speed of propellant loading operations prior to launch.”\n\nBefore Starship can fly for a third time, SpaceX will need to receive a license modification from the FAA. For a timescale comparison, ahead of the second flight test of Starship, the FAA announced the completion of the safety review portion of the launch license evaluation on Oct. 31, 2023, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wrapped up its formal consultation on Nov. 14. That paved the way for a launch license to be issued from the FAA to SpaceX on Nov. 15.\n\nFollowing a wet dress rehearsal tanking test on Oct. 24, SpaceX posted a similar update to social media as its most recent one from Wednesday morning. It stated that Starship was ready for its second test flight “pending regulatory approval.”\n\nVehicle is ready for the second test flight of a fully integrated Starship, pending regulatory approval pic.twitter.com/9tC4yKecmw — SpaceX (@SpaceX) October 25, 2023\n\nThat was followed by another post on X on Nov. 3 stating their hopes of launching “as soon as mid-November, pending regulatory approval.” SpaceX’s next post to X regarding Starship came on Nov. 10, stating “Starship preparing to launch as early as November 17, pending final regulatory approval.”\n\nSpaceX confirmed the intended launch date of Nov. 17 once the launch license was formally approved on Nov. 15. The launch itself pivoted to Nov. 18 due to an issue that came up with a grid fin actuator on the Super Heavy Booster.\n\nGiven that this is the third flight test of Starship and not nearly as much needed to change between flights two and three as did between one and two, the declaration of a March 14 launch date without having a launch license firmly in hand may prove to be true.\n\nHowever, final regulatory approval is still being determined by the FAA.

In an online update, the company said it is targeting Thursday, March 14 for the third flight test of Starship &#8220;pending regulatory approval.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While SpaceX didn&#8217;t publish a launch time on its website, a livestream post on X (formerly Twitter) showed a start time of 7:30 am EST (6:30 a.m. CST, 1230 UTC). Coupled with SpaceX stating that its broadcast would begin about 30 minutes prior to liftoff, that suggests a target launch time of 8:00 a.m. EST (7:00: a.m. CST, 1300 UTC).</p>\n<p>The mission continues SpaceX&#8217;s iterative approach to developing its Starship rocket, which involves flying as much as possible and getting through as much of its mission profile as it can. SpaceX is hoping to push a number of boundaries for the vehicle with this flight.</p>\n<p>On the Ship 28 upper stage for instance, SpaceX aims to test the payload door, conduct a re-ignition of one or more Raptor engines while in space and conduct a propellant transfer demonstration during the coast phase.</p>\n<p>Being able to demonstrate propellant transfer in space is key not only to SpaceX&#8217;s future ambitions, but also to NASA&#8217;s Artemis program. While this flight will perform the transfer within Ship 28, the next big leap will be a ship-to-ship transfer.</p>\n<p>SpaceX will need to launch several Starships in order to fuel a tanker on orbit. That tanker will then be used to shift that propellant to the Human Landing System program&#8217;s version of Starship, which &#160;will carry astronauts down to the surface of the Moon and back up again.</p>\n<p>In February, NASA and SpaceX were busily testing docking mechanisms that will allow its Orion spacecraft to dock with the HLS Starship while in lunar orbit. They performed the work at NASA&#8217;s Marshall Spaceflight Center, the NASA installation where the HLS program is based.</p>\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-65568\" src=\"http://spaceflightnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/20240229_Starship_Orion_docking_test_small.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"584\" height=\"876\">\n<p>While this third flight test won&#8217;t include a payload, SpaceX needs to reach orbit to achieve its stated goals. During a company talk given earlier this year at Starbase in southern Texas, SpaceX founder Elon Musk explained why they believe Starship failed to reach orbit during its second flight test.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Flight 2 almost actually made it to orbit. In fact, ironically, if had had a payload it would&#8217;ve made it to orbit,&#8221; said SpaceX founder Elon Musk during a company talk earlier this year. &#8220;The reason that it didn&#8217;t quite make it to orbit was because we vented the liquid oxygen and the liquid oxygen ultimately led to fire and an explosion.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;We wanted to vent the liquid oxygen because we normally wouldn&#8217;t have that liquid oxygen if we had a payload.

The agency also announced the opening for the next round of NASA astronaut applications.\n\n“Congratulations to the newest class of NASA astronauts! We are excited to have a new and diverse set of explorers ready to expand humanity’s reach,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “Astronauts are pioneers who will help us embark on this new era of exploration, and we need more adventurers ready to join the ranks to explore the cosmos, including future missions to the Moon, on to Mars, and beyond.”\n\nSelected for training in 2021, the astronaut graduates were chosen from a pool of more than 12,000 applicants and successfully completed more than two years of required basic training, including spacewalking, robotics, space station systems, and more.\n\nThe graduates may be assigned to missions destined for the International Space Station, future commercial space stations, and Artemis campaign missions to the Moon in preparation for Mars.\n\n“Congratulations to NASA and the astronaut graduates,” said U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Director Kiran Ahuja. “By partnering with OPM, NASA employed an automated and streamlined hiring process to screen applicants for these prestigious roles. OPM is thrilled to continue supporting NASA experts to design and implement their hiring methods.”\n\n“It’s an incredible time to be an astronaut with a variety of spacecraft to fly and more destinations to explore,” said Chief Astronaut Joe Acaba. “I’m honored to welcome these astronauts, congratulate them on their hard work, and look forward to growing our ranks as we help expand humanity’s reach into the solar system.”\n\nThe graduating NASA astronauts are Nichole Ayers of Colorado Springs, Colorado; Marcos Berríos of Guaynabo, Puerto Rico; Chris Birch of Gilbert, Arizona; Deniz Bunham of Wasilla, Alaska; Luke Delaney of Debary, Florida; Andre Douglas of Chesapeake, Virginia; Jack Hathaway of South Windsor, Connecticut; Anil Menon of Minneapolis; Chris Williams of Potomac, Maryland, and Jessica Wittner of Clovis, California.\n\nContinuing the long tradition of international partnership, two UAE (United Arab Emirates) astronauts, Nora AlMatrooshi and Mohammad AlMulla of the Mohammad Bin Rashid Space Centre, trained alongside their NASA counterparts for the past two years, as well as participated in the graduation ceremony.\n\nThis is one part of the partnership between NASA the UAE, including cooperation on the International Space Station, NASA’s Artemis missions through the Gateway lunar space station, and other activities on Earth and in space that are supporting groundbreaking science and research.\n\nTo apply to become a NASA astronaut, applicants should go to:\n\nhttps://www.usajobs.gov/job/779261100\n\n-end-\n\nJosh Finch / Claire O’Shea\n\nHeadquarters, Washington\n\n202-358-1100\n\njoshua.a.finch@nasa.gov / claire.a.oshea@nasa.gov\n\nChelsey Ballarte\n\nJohnson Space Center, Houston\n\n281-483-5111\n\nchelsey.n.ballarte@nasa.gov",

                "newstext": "Plastics are now everywhere, with tiny fragments found in several major organs of the human body, including the placenta.\n\nGiven how easily the microscopic particles infiltrate our tissues, it's vital that we learn exactly what kinds of risks they could pose to our health.\n\nResearchers have been busy studying the effects of microplastics in mini-replicas of organs, and in mice, to get a sense of how they might impact the human body. However, the concentrations of microplastics used in those studies might not reflect people's real-world exposure, and few studies have been done in humans.\n\nNow, a small study in Italy has found shards of microplastics in fatty deposits surgically removed from patients who had an operation to open up their clogged arteries – and reported their health outcomes nearly 3 years later.\n\nRemoving fatty plaques from narrowed arteries in a procedure called a carotid endarterectomy reduces the risk of future strokes.\n\nThe team behind this new study, led by Raffaele Marfella, a medical researcher at the University of Campania in Naples, wondered how the risk of stroke – as well as heart attacks and death – compared between patients who had microplastics in their plaques and those who did not.\n\nFollowing 257 patients for 34 months, the researchers found nearly 60 percent of them had measurable amounts of polyethylene in plaques pulled from their fat-thickened arteries, and 12 percent also had polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in extracted fat deposits.\n\nPVC comes in both rigid and flexible forms, and is used to make water pipes, plastic bottles, flooring, and packaging. Polyethylene is the most commonly produced plastic, used for plastic bags, films, and bottles, too.\n\nWith microplastics previously found coursing through people's bloodstream, the researchers were reasonably concerned about heart health. Lab-based studies suggest microplastics can trigger inflammation and oxidative stress in heart cells, and impair heart function, alter heart rate, and cause scarring of the heart in animals such as mice.\n\n\"Observational data from occupational-exposure studies [also] suggest an increased risk of cardiovascular disease among persons who are exposed to plastics-related pollution, including polyvinyl chloride, than that seen in the general population,\" Marfella and colleagues write.\n\nIn the study, patients with microplastics in their excised plaques were twice as likely to have experienced a stroke, non-fatal heart attack or died from any cause after 34 months than people who had no detectable microplastics in the plaques that surgeons had removed.\n\nThe amount of microplastics, and even smaller particles called nanoplastics, was measured using a technique called pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, and their presence confirmed using another method, stable isotopes analysis, which can distinguish between the carbon of human tissues and that of plastics made from petrochemicals.\n\nMicroplastics were also visible under powerful microscopes: The researchers observed plastic fragments with jagged edges inside immune cells called macrophages, and within the fatty plaques. Examining the tissue samples, the team also found higher levels of inflammatory markers in patients with microplastics in their plaques.\n\nBear in mind, however, that an observational study like this can't definitively conclude that microplastics are causing the downstream heart effects; only that there is an association. The study did not consider other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as smoking, physical inactivity, and air pollution.\n\n\"Although we do not know what other exposures may have contributed to the adverse outcomes among patients in this study, the finding of microplastics and nanoplastics in plaque tissue is itself a breakthrough discovery that raises a series of urgent questions,\" such as how to reduce exposure, writes pediatrician, public health physician and epidemiologist Philip J. Landrigan, of Boston College, in an accompanying editorial.\n\nPlastic production has exploded in the past two decades, only a fraction of which has been recycled, and yet rates of cardiovascular disease have been falling in some parts of the world, so more research is needed to understand the link between the two.\n\nThe study has been published in the New England Journal of Medicine.",

These patients were found to have a higher risk of strokes, heart attacks, and death within 34 months of the surgery compared to those without microplastics in their plaques. While the study suggests a correlation between microplastic exposure and cardiovascular health, it cannot establish direct causation due to its observational nature.

Marfella and his colleagues wondered whether plastic pollution might be involved in damaging people’s blood vessels by driving inflammation.\n\nWriting in the New England Journal of Medicine, the doctors describe how they analysed fatty plaques removed from 304 patients with atherosclerosis affecting the carotid arteries. The carotid arteries are the main blood vessels that supply blood to the neck, face and brain. The disease causes a build-up of plaque in the arteries, which substantially raises the risk of stroke. The plaques can be removed by a procedure called carotid endarterectomy.\n\nLab tests on the extracted plaques revealed polyethylene in 150 patients and polyvinyl chloride in 31, alongside signs of inflammation. On examination under an electron microscope, the researchers spotted jagged foreign particles in the fatty deposits, most less than a thousandth of a millimetre across.\n\nThe doctors followed 257 of the patients for an average of 34 months after they had carotid plaques removed. Those who had plastic particles in their plaques were 4.5 times more likely to have a stroke or heart attack, or to die from any cause, than those whose plaques were free from plastic pollution.\n\nMarfella said the discovery of plastics in the plaques was “surprising” and that the likely effect on cardiovascular health was “worrisome”. The findings may explain what doctors call “residual cardiovascular risk”, he said, where 20%-30% of patients who have been treated for common risk factors, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, still go on to have heart attacks and strokes.\n\nFurther work is needed to confirm whether plastic pollution plays a role in strokes and heart attacks, but Marfella called for greater awareness of the potential threat.\n\n“People must become aware of the risks we are taking with our lifestyle,” he said. “I hope the alarm message from our study will raise the consciousness of citizens, especially governments, to finally become aware of the importance of the health of our planet. To put it in a slogan that can unite the need for health for humans and the planet, plastic-free is healthy for the heart and the Earth.”\n\nHolly Shiels, professor of integrative physiology at the University of Manchester, said the impact of micro- and nanoplastics on plaque formation and coronary heart disease needed greater attention. “It is conceivable that microplastics and nanoplastics, and the toxins they carry, could trigger events leading to the development of atherosclerosis,” she said.",

In recent years, their ubiquity has become undeniable: They have been found in fresh snowfall in Antarctica and at the depths of the Marianas Trench, as well as in human blood; breast milk; urine; and placental, lung and liver tissue.\n\nDr. Raffaele Marfella — a cardiology researcher in the University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli’s department of advanced medical and surgical sciences in Naples, Italy, and the lead author of the new study — said that he and his colleagues initiated the study to look for new risk factors for cardiovascular disease.\n\nThey knew of the enormous amount of degraded plastic pollution contaminating the planet and wondered “whether plastic, in the form of micro- or nanoplastics, could also degrade our arteries,” Marfella said in an email. People can inhale and ingest the plastic particles. The plastic can also enter the body through skin.\n\nA blue rectangular piece of microplastic on the finger of a researcher in Tacoma, Wash. (Ted S. Warren / AP file )\n\nTo study the effects, they turned to a group of patients already scheduled to undergo surgery for a condition called carotid artery stenosis, in which plaque, or fatty deposits, blocks normal blood flow. The body’s two carotid arteries supply blood to the brain, face and neck. The researchers looked at plaque removed from 257 patients and tracked the patients’ health for an average of 34 months following the surgery.\n\nThey found plastic particles — mostly nanoplastics — in the plaque of 150 patients. At follow-up, nonfatal heart attack, nonfatal stroke or death from any cause occurred in 20% of those patients and in 7.5% of the patients without detectable plastic particles.\n\nAfter adjusting for age, sex, body mass index and health conditions such as diabetes and abnormal cholesterol, the patients with detectable levels of plastics had “nearly a five times greater risk of a cardiovascular event” than the other patients, Marfella said.\n\nNumerous experimental studies on cells and in animals have shown that the presence of these plastic particles increases diseases. One study published online in February in the Journal of Hazardous Materials found microplastics, for the first time, in human arteries.\n\nPrevious studies finding the tiny particles in human tissue were “pioneering,” said Dick Vethaak, a biologist and toxicologist at Utrecht University’s Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences and coordinator of the Dutch Microplastics and Human Health Consortium, but this study “is the first of its kind.”\n\n“It is the first one that looked at a large number of donors in so much detail” and the first to follow patients for years to track their health, said Vethaak, who wasn’t involved with the new study.\n\nHowever, this kind of observational study can show only an association between the plastic particles and heart attack, stroke or death. It cannot show that they caused these cardiovascular events. For that, researchers would need to conduct a randomized, controlled trial, but it would be unethical to intentionally expose people to potential toxins.\n\nNevertheless, the study offers some hints about the relationship between the presence of micro- and nanoplastics and heart disease, said Dr. Martha Gulati, director of preventive cardiology in the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles.\n\n“We know that cardiovascular disease, particularly myocardial infarction, is usually triggered by an inflammatory response,” Gulati said, using another term for heart attack. The Italian researchers measured markers for inflammation in patients and found that those markers increased as the level of plastics in the plaque rose.\n\nStill, “is the inflammation due to the nanoplastics or something else?” Gulati asked.\n\nBecause the study was carried out in a very specific group of patients, the results cannot be applied to the broader population. But it could pave the way for future studies.\n\n“This paper might provoke people to figure out if we can measure micro- and nanoplastics in the general population and then examine who goes on to develop cardiac events,” Gulati said.\n\nVethaak said similar studies are in the pipeline for other kinds of human tissue.\n\nThe researchers also noted the possibility that the plaque samples could have been contaminated in the lab.\n\n“Future studies performed with the use of clean rooms, where there is no plastic in any form except the material under study, might corroborate our observations,” they wrote in the paper.\n\n“I hope that this study, and more work that it triggers, helps us address our environment and cardiovascular health because I feel like this is something that really needs to be discussed,” Gulati said. “It gets very little attention.”\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

                        "newstext": "Plastics are just about everywhere — food packaging, tyres, clothes, water pipes. And they shed microscopic particles that end up in the environment and can be ingested or inhaled by people.\n\nNow the first data of their kind show a link between these microplastics and human health. A study of more than 200 people undergoing surgery found that nearly 60% had microplastics or even smaller nanoplastics in a main artery1. Those who did were 4.5 times more likely to experience a heart attack, a stroke or death in the approximately 34 months after the surgery than were those whose arteries were plastic-free.\n\n“This is a landmark trial,” says Robert Brook, a physician-scientist at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, who studies the environmental effects on cardiovascular health and was not involved with the study. “This will be the launching pad for further studies across the world to corroborate, extend and delve into the degree of the risk that micro- and nanoplastics pose.”\n\nBut Brook, other researchers and the authors themselves caution that this study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine on 6 March, does not show that the tiny pieces caused poor health. Other factors that the researchers did not study, such as socio-economic status, could be driving ill health rather than the plastics themselves, they say.\n\nPlastic planet\n\nScientists have found microplastics just about everywhere they’ve looked: in oceans; in shellfish; in breast milk; in drinking water; wafting in the air; and falling with rain.\n\nSuch contaminants are not only ubiquitous but also long-lasting, often requiring centuries to break down. As a result, cells responsible for removing waste products can’t readily degrade them, so microplastics accumulate in organisms.\n\nMicroplastics are everywhere — but are they harmful?\n\nIn humans, they have been found in the blood and in organs such as the lungs and placenta. However, just because they accumulate doesn’t mean they cause harm. Scientists have been worried about the health effects of microplastics for around 20 years, but what those effects are has proved difficult to evaluate rigorously, says Philip Landrigan, a paediatrician and epidemiologist at Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts.\n\nGiuseppe Paolisso, an internal-medicine physician at the University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli in Caserta, Italy, and his colleagues knew that microplastics are attracted to fat molecules, so they were curious about whether the particles would build up in fatty deposits called plaques that can form on the lining of blood vessels. The team tracked 257 people undergoing a surgical procedure that reduces stroke risk by removing plaque from an artery in the neck.\n\nBlood record\n\nThe researchers put the excised plaques under an electron microscope. They saw jagged blobs — evidence of microplastics — intermingled with cells and other waste products in samples from 150 of the participants. Chemical analyses revealed that the bulk of the particles were composed of either polyethylene, which is the most used plastic in the world and is often found in food packaging, shopping bags and medical tubing, or polyvinyl chloride, known more commonly as PVC or vinyl.\n\nMicroplastic particles (arrows) infiltrate a living immune cell called a macrophage that was removed from a fatty deposit in a study participant’s blood vessel.Credit: R. Marfella et al./N Engl J Med\n\nOn average, participants who had more microplastics in their plaque samples also had higher levels of biomarkers for inflammation, analyses revealed. That hints at how the particles could contribute to ill health, Brook says. If they help to trigger inflammation, they might boost the risk that a plaque will rupture, spilling fatty deposits that could clog blood vessels.\n\nCompared to participants who didn’t have microplastics in their plaques, participants who did were younger; more likely to be male; more likely to smoke and more likely to have diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Because the study included only people who required surgery to reduce stroke risk, it is unknown whether the link holds true in a broader population.\n\nBrook is curious about the 40% of participants who showed no evidence of microplastics in their plaques, especially given that it is nearly impossible to avoid plastics altogether. Study co-author Sanjay Rajagopalan, a cardiologist at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, says it’s possible that these participants behave differently or have different biological pathways for processing the plastics, but more research is needed.\n\nStalled progress\n\nThe study comes as diplomats try to hammer out a global treaty to eliminate plastic pollution. In 2022, 175 nations voted to create a legally binding international agreement, with a goal of finalizing it by the end of 2024.\n\nResearchers have fought for more input into the process, noting that progress on the treaty has been too slow. The latest study is likely to light a fire under negotiators when they gather in Ottawa in April, says Landrigan, who co-authored a report2 that recommended a global cap on plastic production.\n\nWhile Rajagopalan awaits further data on microplastics, his findings have already had an impact on his daily life. “I’ve had a much more conscious, intentional look at my own relationship with plastics,” he says. “I hope this study brings some introspection into how we, as a society, use petroleum-derived products to reshape the biosphere.”",

Share this link with them to sign up.\n\nGood afternoon! The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced two major new Covid recommendations last week.\n\nThe first – and much more controversial – change applies to nearly all of us. People who test positive for Covid-19 no longer need to stay away from others for at least five days, according to new guidelines the CDC issued Friday.\n\nThe second, less surprising shift targets a narrower population: seniors. The CDC on Thursday recommended that people ages 65 and older get an additional updated shot against the virus this spring.\n\nThe separate announcements show the tricky balancing act that the CDC faces as the pandemic enters its fifth year.\n\nOn one hand, the agency is trying to relax and simplify its prior health guidelines to reflect the progress the U.S. has made in reducing hospitalizations and deaths from Covid over the last two years.\n\nDoing so also aims to make the CDC's guidance easier for Americans to understand and follow, especially at a time when many of them are no longer willing or able to spend a week out of work or school.\n\nOn the other hand, the CDC is still trying to stress the importance of using vaccines and treatments to combat the virus. Those protective tools are critical for people at higher risk of severe complications from Covid, including older adults and immunocompromised patients.\n\nNow, let's dig into the details of the two new recommendations.\n\nThe CDC's new isolation guidelines say people with Covid may resume daily activities if:\n\nThey've been fever-free without medication for at least 24 hours. Their symptoms are improving overall for at least 24 hours.\n\nThat matches the agency's public health advice for the flu and other respiratory illnesses. Notably, the recommendation does not apply to health-care settings or nursing homes.\n\nThe CDC recommends that people who are recovering from Covid or other respiratory viruses take additional precautions for five days. They include wearing well-fitting masks, washing their hands, limiting close contact with others, improving ventilation in their spaces and testing as needed.\n\nThe agency noted that U.S. states and countries that have already shortened their Covid isolation times have not seen increased hospitalizations or deaths related to Covid. That includes California and Oregon.\n\nPreviously, the CDC recommended that people with Covid stay home for at least five days to reduce the chances of spreading the virus to others. The agency's initial isolation period was 10 days.\n\nSome health experts had urged the agency to shorten that period even before the official announcement last week.\n\nDr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told NBC News last month that he and his colleagues have privately encouraged the CDC to drop the five-day isolation period. He said that's partly because there's little evidence it's stopping the spread of the virus.\n\nOther experts were critical of the CDC's new guidance.\n\nThe agency's new guidance \"promotes people shedding virus to infect others,\" Dr. Eric Topol, founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said in a post on X. He added that, based on evidence from rapid antigen tests, most people will still be infectious if they exit isolation earlier.",

The CDC on Thursday recommended that people ages 65 and older get an additional updated shot against the virus this spring.\n\nThe separate announcements show the tricky balancing act that the CDC faces as the pandemic enters its fifth year.\n\nOn one hand, the agency is trying to relax and simplify its prior health guidelines to reflect the progress the U.S. has made in reducing hospitalizations and deaths from Covid over the last two years.\n\nDoing so also aims to make the CDC's guidance easier for Americans to understand and follow, especially at a time when many of them are no longer willing or able to spend a week out of work or school.\n\nOn the other hand, the CDC is still trying to stress the importance of using vaccines and treatments to combat the virus. Those protective tools are critical for people at higher risk of severe complications from Covid, including older adults and immunocompromised patients.\n\nNow, let's dig into the details of the two new recommendations.\n\nThe CDC's new isolation guidelines say people with Covid may resume daily activities if:\n\nThey've been fever-free without medication for at least 24 hours. Their symptoms are improving overall for at least 24 hours.\n\nThat matches the agency's public health advice for the flu and other respiratory illnesses. Notably, the recommendation does not apply to health-care settings or nursing homes.\n\nThe CDC recommends that people who are recovering from Covid or other respiratory viruses take additional precautions for five days. They include wearing well-fitting masks, washing their hands, limiting close contact with others, improving ventilation in their spaces and testing as needed.\n\nThe agency noted that U.S. states and countries that have already shortened their Covid isolation times have not seen increased hospitalizations or deaths related to Covid. That includes California and Oregon.\n\nPreviously, the CDC recommended that people with Covid stay home for at least five days to reduce the chances of spreading the virus to others. The agency's initial isolation period was 10 days.\n\nSome health experts had urged the agency to shorten that period even before the official announcement last week.\n\nDr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told NBC News last month that he and his colleagues have privately encouraged the CDC to drop the five-day isolation period. He said that's partly because there's little evidence it's stopping the spread of the virus.\n\nOther experts were critical of the CDC's new guidance.\n\nThe agency's new guidance \"promotes people shedding virus to infect others,\" Dr. Eric Topol, founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said in a post on X. He added that, based on evidence from rapid antigen tests, most people will still be infectious if they exit isolation earlier.",

The new guidance brings a unified approach to addressing risks from a range of common respiratory viral illnesses, such as COVID-19, flu, and RSV, which can cause significant health impacts and strain on hospitals and health care workers. CDC is making updates to the recommendations now because the U.S. is seeing far fewer hospitalizations and deaths associated with COVID-19 and because we have more tools than ever to combat flu, COVID, and RSV.\n\n“Today’s announcement reflects the progress we have made in protecting against severe illness from COVID-19,” said CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen. “However, we still must use the commonsense solutions we know work to protect ourselves and others from serious illness from respiratory viruses—this includes vaccination, treatment, and staying home when we get sick.”\n\nAs part of the guidance, CDC provides active recommendations on core prevention steps and strategies:\n\nStaying up to date with vaccination to protect people against serious illness, hospitalization, and death. This includes flu, COVID-19, and RSV if eligible.\n\nto protect people against serious illness, hospitalization, and death. This includes flu, COVID-19, and RSV if eligible.

Taking steps for cleaner air, such as bringing in more fresh outside air, purifying indoor air, or gathering outdoors.\n\nWhen people get sick with a respiratory virus, the updated guidance recommends that they stay home and away from others. For people with COVID-19 and influenza, treatment is available and can lessen symptoms and lower the risk of severe illness. The recommendations suggest returning to normal activities when, for at least 24 hours, symptoms are improving overall, and if a fever was present, it has been gone without use of a fever-reducing medication.\n\nOnce people resume normal activities, they are encouraged to take additional prevention strategies for the next 5 days to curb disease spread, such as taking more steps for cleaner air, enhancing hygiene practices, wearing a well-fitting mask, keeping a distance from others, and/or getting tested for respiratory viruses. Enhanced precautions are especially important to protect those most at risk for severe illness, including those over 65 and people with weakened immune systems. CDC’s updated guidance reflects how the circumstances around COVID-19 in particular have changed. While it remains a threat, today it is far less likely to cause severe illness because of widespread immunity and improved tools to prevent and treat the disease. Importantly, states and countries that have already adjusted recommended isolation times have not seen increased hospitalizations or deaths related to COVID-19.\n\nWhile every respiratory virus does not act the same, adopting a unified approach to limiting disease spread makes recommendations easier to follow and thus more likely to be adopted and does not rely on individuals to test for illness, a practice that data indicates is uneven.\n\n“The bottom line is that when people follow these actionable recommendations to avoid getting sick, and to protect themselves and others if they do get sick, it will help limit the spread of respiratory viruses, and that will mean fewer people who experience severe illness,” National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases Director Dr. Demetre Daskalakis said. “That includes taking enhanced precautions that can help protect people who are at higher risk for getting seriously ill.”\n\nThe updated guidance also includes specific sections with additional considerations for people who are at higher risk of severe illness from respiratory viruses, including people who are immunocompromised, people with disabilities, people who are or were recently pregnant, young children, and older adults. Respiratory viruses remain a public health threat. CDC will continue to focus efforts on ensuring the public has the information and tools to lower their risk or respiratory illness by protecting themselves, families, and communities.\n\nThis updated guidance is intended for community settings. There are no changes to respiratory virus guidance for healthcare settings.",

                        "newstext": "What makes for good public health guidance? That’s the conversation I was having with a colleague in her 40s railing against the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s erstwhile guidance about alcohol consumption for women of “childbearing” years. The guidance, if followed closely, would mean that all women ages 15 to 49 should fully abstain from alcohol consumption unless they’re using birth control. That’s more than 77 million women in the U.S. alone. The CDC guidance was finally archived last year, along with a similar proposal from the World Health Organization. For good reason: It’s absurd.\n\nIn four years of the Covid pandemic, we have seen lots and lots of guidance change over time. Most recently, the CDC has relaxed its recommendations about isolating after testing positive for Covid.\n\nadvertisement\n\nPeople often ask: How much should guidance be based on evidence versus what the public is willing to do? But that’s the wrong way to think about it. Instead, those in charge of public health guidance should consider the burden it imposes on people to change their behavior, balanced against the health benefits the change can offer to them and those around them.\n\nThe CDC’s new guidance on what to do after a Covid infection has been controversial among some. It says that you should isolate when symptomatic but when the fever subsides and symptoms improve, you can end isolation. Using this lens of burdens and benefits, the new approach makes a lot of sense.\n\nThe abstention from alcohol for women between the ages of 15-49 (unless using birth control) is a great example of applying that framework. On the surface, it may make sense — fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a serious issue. Many women don’t know that they’re pregnant for some period of time after conception. If the goal was to eradicate all instances of FAS, ensuring no women of childbearing age ever drank alcohol would indeed be a reasonable recommendation.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBut most instances of FAS aren’t from having occasional alcohol early in pregnancy. They are largely driven by heavy, often binge drinking through much of pregnancy. So asking all women to stop drinking alcohol during their potential childbearing years? That is a very high burden. It would theoretically be beneficial. But the absurdly high cost for a small benefit means it makes no sense.\n\nWhen we think about other public health guidance that does make sense — hand-washing after using the bathroom, wearing a seat belt in a car, getting the flu or Covid vaccine if you are older — these are all low-burden, high-benefit activities. Even when the burden is moderate or high, the benefits can be worth it: quitting cigarettes, losing weight if you have obesity, limiting the number of sexual partners and/or using condoms for sexual activity. None of these are easy. Many people are not willing to do them. But that doesn’t change the fact that the benefits of doing so far outweigh the burden — and thus, the public health recommendation makes sense.\n\nSo how does this framework apply to the new Covid-19 isolation guidelines? In 2020, without vaccines or widely available treatments, Covid-19 infections caused serious illness, hospitalizations, deaths, and, even for young healthy people, long Covid. Reducing the spread of infection was critically important, and the best way to do that was asking people who were infected to isolate for five to 10 days, with masking and multiple negative tests as potential ways to end the isolation a little earlier.\n\nThat imposed a substantial burden. People missed work — and for those who don’t have paid sick leave, that loss of income can be the difference between paying the rent and putting food on the table. Kids missed school. Parents who were isolating couldn’t take care of their children. These are indeed large burdens, but for years, the benefits were very large and worthwhile: keeping people alive, reducing hospitalizations, decreasing long Covid.\n\nBut that is no longer the consequence of Covid. With nearly everyone in the U.S. having some degree of immunity against the virus (CDC estimates 98% of Americans have been infected or vaccinated or both), the consequences of infection in 2024 are just very different for the majority. (The very highest-risk people still can get quite sick, especially if they haven’t kept up with their vaccines. But most high-risk people can remain safe.) The goal of isolation guidelines should be to weigh the burdens of individuals and their families against the benefits.\n\nIn that light, asking people to isolate while they are symptomatic — have a fever, symptoms getting worse — makes sense. They are likely to be quite contagious. But as symptoms wane, so too does contagiousness. So while someone a week after symptoms could still be contagious, they are much less so. And the risk of spreading the virus days after symptoms have abated is low. As is the consequence.\n\nBut the burden of isolating many days after symptoms have resolved is very high. In 2020, this recommendation made sense. In 2024? Not so much.\n\nNewsletters Sign up for First Opinion The smartest thinkers in life sciences on what's happening — and what's to come Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy\n\nThe explosion of public health science over the past 50 years has identified lots and lots of things that can potentially improve health. Some of these things have large benefits while others small. If we took an absolutist approach — in which public health officials issued guidance for everything that provided any benefit — we would end up recommending that people never eat bacon, likely avoid all meat, never drink alcohol (no amount is safe!), never drive above 30 miles per hour, and so forth. Sure, those things have benefits, but the benefits of avoiding bacon (technically a Group 1 carcinogen) are small — and for bacon lovers, the burden is high.\n\nPublic health guidance has been confusing during the pandemic. It feels like it keeps changing, leading people to ask: Is the science changing? Sometimes yes, our scientific understanding does change as we learn new things. But that’s not the only thing that should drive our guidance. As population immunity grows, the benefits of avoiding infection by taking on high burdens wanes. And as the pandemic progresses, our guidance should absolutely change to reflect not just new science, but the new realities of the burdens and benefits.\n\nAshish K.

Not so much.</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"stat-form-inline-kicker\" href=\"/signup/\">Newsletters</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"stat-form-inline-header\">Sign up for First Opinion</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"stat-form-inline-description\">The smartest thinkers in life sciences on what's happening &#8212; and what's to come</p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\"stat-field-error\">Please enter a valid email address.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"privacy-link\"><a href=\"/privacy/\">Privacy Policy</a></span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<p class=\"stat-hubspot-signup-response\"></p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n<p>The explosion of public health science over the past 50 years has identified lots and lots of things that can potentially improve health. Some of these things have large benefits while others small. If we took an absolutist approach &#8212; in which public health officials issued guidance for everything that provided any benefit &#8212; we would end up recommending that people never eat bacon, likely avoid all meat, never drink alcohol (no amount is safe!), never drive above 30 miles per hour, and so forth. Sure, those things have benefits, but the benefits of avoiding bacon (technically a <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/cancer-carcinogenicity-of-the-consumption-of-red-meat-and-processed-meat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Group 1 carcinogen</a>) are small &#8212; and for bacon lovers, the burden is high.</p>\n<p>Public health guidance has been confusing during the pandemic. It feels like it keeps changing, leading people to ask: Is the science changing? Sometimes yes, our scientific understanding does change as we learn new things. But that&#8217;s not the only thing that should drive our guidance. As population immunity grows, the benefits of avoiding infection by taking on high burdens wanes. And as the pandemic progresses, our guidance should absolutely change to reflect not just new science, but the new realities of the burdens and benefits.</p>\n<p>Ashish K.

                        "summaryai": "Good public health guidance considers the burden of changing behavior against the potential health benefits for individuals and society. It should not be based solely on evidence or public willingness but instead on a balanced assessment of the costs and benefits. Effective guidance involves low-burden, high-benefit activities, such as hand washing and seat belt use, while guidance with high burdens should only be recommended if the benefits outweigh the costs. As the pandemic progresses and population immunity increases, public health guidance should evolve to reflect the changing burdens and benefits of infection prevention measures."
