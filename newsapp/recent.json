                "newstext": "CAIRO (AP) — Hamas said Thursday that its delegation has left Cairo and that talks on a Gaza cease-fire and hostage release will resume next week, making it extremely unlikely that mediators will broker a deal before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.\n\nMediators had looked to Ramadan as an informal deadline because the month of dawn-to-dusk fasting often sees Israeli-Palestinian violence linked to access to a major Jerusalem holy site. The war already has the wider region on edge, with Iran-backed groups trading fire with Israel and the United States.\n\nEgyptian officials had earlier said the negotiations had reached an impasse over Hamas’ demand for a phased process culminating in an end to the war. But they did not rule out a deal before Ramadan, which is expected to begin on Sunday.\n\nHamas spokesman Jihad Taha said Israel “refuses to commit to and give guarantees regarding the cease-fire, the return of the displaced, and withdrawal from the areas of its incursion.” But he said the talks were still ongoing and would resume next week. There was no immediate comment from Israel.\n\nThe U.S., Egypt and Qatar have been trying for weeks to broker an agreement on a six-week cease-fire and the release of 40 hostages held in Gaza in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned in Israel.\n\nThe Egyptian officials said Hamas has agreed to the main terms of such an agreement as a first stage but wants commitments that it will lead to an eventual more permanent cease-fire. They say Israel wants to confine the negotiations to the more limited agreement.\n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the negotiations with media. Both officials said mediators are still pressing the two parties to soften their positions.\n\nHamas has said it will not release all of the remaining hostages without a full Israeli withdrawal from the territory. Palestinian militants are believed to be holding around 100 hostages and the remains of 30 others captured during Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack into Israel that triggered the war.\n\nHamas is also demanding the release of a large number of prisoners, including top militants serving life sentences, in exchange for the remaining hostages.\n\nHamas is believed to be holding the hostages deep inside its vast tunnel network, where rescue operations would be virtually impossible, and using them as human shields for its top leaders. It hopes to use them as bargaining chips to end the war on its terms.\n\nThat poses a major dilemma for Israel, which at some point may have to choose between its two main goals of bringing back the hostages and trying to annihilate Hamas.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly ruled out Hamas’ demands, saying Israel intends to resume the offensive after any cease-fire, expand it to the crowded southern city of Rafah and battle on until “total victory.” He has said military pressure will help bring about the release of the hostages.\n\nRamadan is a time of heightened prayer, reflection and charity for Muslims the world over, who hold festive nightly gatherings with family and friends after fasting ends at sundown. The lunar month is expected to begin Sunday or Monday, depending on the sighting of the moon.\n\nIn past years, Israeli forces and Palestinians have clashed in Jerusalem over access to the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, the third holiest site in Islam. The hilltop on which it is built is the holiest site for Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount because it was the location of the Jewish temples in antiquity.\n\nHamas says it launched the Oct. 7 attack partly in response to what it sees as Israel’s encroachment on the site and has called for heightened confrontations with Israel during the holy month. Israeli authorities say access to the site will remain unchanged from previous years.\n\nHamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and captured another 250 when they stormed across the border on Oct. 7. Over 100 hostages were released in a cease-fire deal last year.\n\nIsrael launched a massive air, land and sea campaign in Gaza that has driven some 80% of the population from their homes and pushed hundreds of thousands to the brink of famine.\n\nGaza’s Health Ministry says at least 30,717 Palestinians have been killed. It does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its tallies but says women and children make up around two-thirds of those killed. The ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government, maintains detailed records and its casualty figures from previous wars have largely matched those of the U.N. and independent experts.\n\nIsrael says it has killed over 13,000 Hamas fighters, without providing evidence. It blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas because its fighters operate in dense, residential neighborhoods.\n\nGaza is mired in a humanitarian crisis, and conditions are particularly dire in the north, where the offensive has caused widespread devastation. Many of the estimated 300,000 people still living there have been reduced to eating animal fodder to survive, and the U.N. says one in six children younger than 2 in the north suffers from acute malnutrition.\n\nFacing global calls to alleviate the crisis, Israeli officials said Wednesday that it will begin allowing aid to move directly from its territory into northern Gaza and will also cooperate with the creation of a sea route from Cyprus.\n\nAid groups have said it has become nearly impossible to deliver supplies within most of Gaza because of the difficulty of coordinating with the Israeli military, the ongoing hostilities and the breakdown of public order. It is even more difficult to get aid to the north.\n\n___\n\nSewell reported from Beirut.\n\n___\n\nFind more of AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war",

The suspected smugglers - and the animals - were headed for Mumbai, India, the department added.\n\nIn addition to the discovery of the red panda on Monday, Thailand’s Customs Department said that it had found a cotton-top tamarin monkey, a fishing cat and a Sulawesi bear cuscus in the suspected smugglers’ suitcases.\n\nLizards, snakes, birds, squirrels and bats were also amongst the animals discovered, the customs department said.\n\nA cotton-top tamarin monkey was also found in the luggage of a group of Indian nationals attempting to travel to Mumbai, India. Thailand's Customs Department/AFP via Getty Images\n\nImages released alongside the Thai Customs Department’s statement show animals stowed in wicker baskets, plastic tubs and fabric bags inside large wheeled suitcases. The suitcases were intended to be loaded onto an airplane, the statement alleged.\n\nAccording to the Thai Customs Department, the individuals suspected of smuggling the animals violated several laws, including the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which regulates the international trade of wild species of plants and animals.\n\nThe suspects are also accused of attempting to export live animals without declaring them and violating animal disease control laws, the customs department said.\n\nA parrot that was rescued alongside 86 other animals, who were found in wicker baskets, plastic tubs, and fabric bags inside suitcases headed to Mumbai, India. Thailand's Customs Department/AFP via Getty Images\n\nA 2018 report by TRAFFIC, a non-governmental organization that campaigns against the “illegal and unsustainable trade in wild species,” found that there were 1,346 seizures of wildlife and wildlife products in the air transport sector between 2009 and 2016.\n\nThis form of wildlife trafficking took place in 136 countries’ airports between 2009 and 2017, the report said, with Thailand reporting the second highest number of these incidents in the world.\n\n‘Growing fad’ of exotic pets\n\nKanitha Krishnasamy, director of TRAFFIC’s Southeast Asia office, said in a statement to CNN Thursday that the organization has seen a “very active and persistent level of trafficking of live animals between Southeast Asia and South Asia.”\n\nKrishnasamy said that this includes a “string of cases of live wild animal smuggling via air” between Thailand and India in recent years, with “busts taking place in both countries since early 2022.”\n\nKrishnasamy suggested that the increase in attempted wildlife trafficking into India is due to a “growing fad” of exotic pets, including kangaroos, cuscus and red pandas.\n\n“We need to get to the bottom of the market in India,” Krishnasamy said. “A robust understanding of the contemporary pet market is needed to guide future interventions, including on strengthened regulation and reducing demand.”",

                "newstext": "Washington CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Thursday will address Congress and the American people in what could be the most consequential speech of his presidency, seeking to boast about his first term while also warning the country about what he views as a ruinous threat to its very existence.\n\nWhile State of the Union addresses have typically been opportunities for presidents to present themselves at their most bridge-building and presidential, the primary results on Super Tuesday, which effectively consolidated the 2024 campaign into a two-man race, gives this year’s speech a political hue.\n\nWhile it remains to be seen how often Biden will invoke former President Donald Trump’s name – or whether he will choose to at all – the 2024 general election campaign, for all intents and purposes, will be kicked off with Biden’s speech.\n\nAs he delivers the address, Biden will command the attention of what might well be his largest crowd before November, giving voters concerned about his age and stamina a crucial barometer to determine whether the 81-year-old president is up for another four years in the job one month after a special counsel’s report faulted his memory and cognition.\n\nIt also gives Biden the opportunity to present his administration’s biggest wins directly to the American people, bypassing the traditional media, which Biden has frequently complained obfuscates his accomplishments and base of support.\n\nTouting his economic record, even if Americans aren’t perceiving a windfall\n\nThe United States economy has outperformed experts’ expectations since a year ago, when many economists thought it would be undergoing a recession right now.\n\nThat hasn’t happened for a variety of reasons. It’s not looking like it will anytime soon either with an unemployment rate that’s stayed below 4% for the past 24 months.\n\nBut Americans aren’t feeling so optimistic. In survey after survey, they’ve conveyed strong disapproval of the state of the economy, something Biden has struggled to wrap his head around.\n\nInflation is at the core of their consternation.\n\nEven though price increases have moderated significantly from two years ago, Americans are paying 18% for goods and services compared to before Biden took office, according to Consumer Price Index data.\n\nIt’s an issue Biden has acknowledged in the past and pledged to fix. His rhetoric on the economy has recently taken a more populist tone, with Biden saying in remarks earlier this year that “For all we’ve done to bring prices down, there are still too many corporations in America ripping people off.”\n\n“Price gouging, junk feeds, greedflation, shrinkflation,” Biden said in remarks in Columbia, South Carolina, adding the country is “tired of being played for suckers.”\n\nEven Cookie Monster has complained about feeling the pinch in his amorphous wallet.\n\nTwo days before Thursday’s address, Biden’s administration launched a new strike force with the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission “to root out and stop illegal corporate behavior” that results in higher prices for Americans.\n\nThis effort, aimed at demonstrating to Americans that he hasn’t lost sight of the impact high prices are having, will come up in Biden’s remarks Thursday, White House national economic adviser Lael Brainard told reporters on a call Monday night.\n\nThe Biden administration has also focused on lowering drug prices and health care costs more broadly, both through laws aimed at reducing costs and through administrative proposals aimed at increasing competition.\n\nFor instance, the administration proposed a rule in November governing the financial incentives that health insurers offering Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D drug plans can provide to brokers and agents.\n\nThe proposal would set up guardrails to prevent plans from providing excessive compensation to brokers and agents to steer potential enrollees to their policies rather than those in senior citizens’ best interests.\n\nFailed border deal and abortion rights provide a contrast with Trump\n\nFollowing the failure, at Trump’s urging, of a bipartisan deal that would have included significant border concessions from Biden, the president promised to make his case directly to the American people – blaming Trump directly for an issue that many Americans say is their top concern heading into November.\n\nBiden will have his largest platform yet to do so on Thursday.\n\nVisiting the US-Mexico border on the same day as Trump last week, Biden offered his foe an olive branch, entreating the former president to work with him to find a solution that would strengthen the United States’ southern border and overhaul its immigration system.\n\nTrump, who hopes to use illegal immigration as a political cudgel against Biden, has not accepted a truce.\n\nBiden has repeatedly cited Republican cowardice to stand up to Trump as the key reason why a deal failed. He’ll have a chance on Thursday to call out congressional Republicans directly.\n\nHe’ll also have the opportunity to elucidate his efforts to protect abortion rights in the United States, and the threat posed to those rights if Trump were to be elected again. The president and his administration have spent much of the time since the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade by the Supreme Court blaming Trump for the decision.\n\nDefending America’s role abroad\n\nSpeaking directly to the Republican-controlled House that dismantled hopes of the border deal that contained funding for Ukraine and Israel, Biden will have the chance to lay out in vivid detail the price of Republican waffling on additional support to the country in its third year of war against Russia.\n\nThe lack of further US-funded ammunition has had serious consequences for Ukrainian soldiers on the battlefield, and Biden has frequently said that history will judge harshly the lack of resolve shown in continuing to fund the country’s defense.\n\nThe speech comes weeks after Ukraine announced a withdrawal from the strategic hub of Avdiivka after fighting dealt heavy casualties to the Ukrainians, and as other world leaders doubt the future of American leadership abroad in a hypothetical second Trump term.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump - who has always been wary of leveling any sort of criticism at Russian President Vladimir Putin - has sharpened his rhetoric around withdrawing the United States from international partnerships, saying he would encourage Russia to attack US allies who don’t meet NATO spending guidelines and offering no criticism of Putin for the death of his leading critic, Alexey Navalny.\n\nPerhaps in an effort to drive Biden’s point home, the White House announced that Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, and Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska were both invited by the White House to watch Biden’s address. Neither were able to attend.\n\nBiden will also have the opportunity to defend his stance on Israel’s continued war in Gaza, as his continued, albeit increasingly tepid, support for the war threatens to turn a key progressive faction against him.\n\nWarning about democracy and threats at home\n\nBiden on Tuesday posted a picture on social media of himself reading the first page of his speech’s draft during preparations at Camp David.\n\nWhile that page contained the greetings customarily given by the president to the House speaker, members of Congress, the vice president and the American people, a close look reveals a name Biden hoped to invoke in his address, at least in its initial drafts.\n\nVisible semi-transparently through the first page is President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s name and the beginning of his 1941 speech to Congress, in which the nation’s 32nd president famously proposed four fundamental freedoms - freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear - and extolled the virtues of democracy across the world.\n\nOpening his address, Roosevelt told members of the 77th Congress that he was speaking to them “at a moment unprecedented in the history of the Union.”\n\n“I use the word ‘unprecedented,’ because at no previous time has American security been as seriously threatened from without as it is today,” Roosevelt said.\n\nBiden has made his own warnings - increasingly dire in recent months - about a threat to the US’ security.

Neither were able to attend.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder\">\n            Biden will also have the opportunity to defend his stance on Israel&#8217;s continued war in Gaza, as his continued, albeit increasingly tepid, support for the war threatens to turn a key progressive faction against him.\n    </p>\n\n  <h2 class=\"subheader\" id=\"warning-about-democracy-and-threats-at-home\">\n    Warning about democracy and threats at home\n</h2>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder\">\n            Biden on Tuesday posted a picture on social media of himself reading the first page of his speech&#8217;s draft during preparations at Camp David.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder\">\n            While that page contained the greetings customarily given by the president to the House speaker, members of Congress, the vice president and the American people, a close look reveals a name Biden hoped to invoke in his address, at least in its initial drafts.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder\">\n            Visible semi-transparently through the first page is President Franklin D.

Biden will likely highlight his economic record, while acknowledging the ongoing concerns about inflation. He will also address immigration, calling out Trump for the failed border deal and focusing on protecting abortion rights. In foreign policy, Biden will emphasize the importance of supporting Ukraine in its war against Russia and defend his position on Israel's actions in Gaza. Moreover, he will warn against threats to American democracy from within, echoing Franklin D. Roosevelt's concerns expressed on January 6, 1941."

                        "newstext": "WASHINGTON, D.C. – First Lady Jill Biden will welcome guests to join her in the viewing box for President Biden’s State of the Union Address on Thursday, March 7, 2024. Each of these individuals were invited by the White House because they personify issues or themes to be addressed by the President in his speech, or they embody the Biden-Harris Administration’s policies at work for the American people. The Second Gentleman, Mr. Douglas Emhoff, will also join the First Lady in the viewing box.\n\n\n\nThe following individuals, listed in alphabetical order, will be seated in the box with the First Lady and Second Gentleman:\n\n\n\nLatorya Beasley (Birmingham, Alabama)\n\nBeasley and her husband had their first child through in vitro fertilization (IVF) in 2022 and were in the process of expanding their family through another round of IVF when her embryo transfer was abruptly canceled as a result of the recent Alabama Supreme Court decision. Her recent experience is yet another example of how the overturning of Roe v. Wade has disrupted access to reproductive health care for women and families across the country.\n\n\n\nKris Blackley (Fort Mill, South Carolina)\n\nBlackley is an oncology nurse and the Director of Patient Navigation for the Atrium Health Levine Cancer Institute, part of Advocate Health. She has published research related to patient navigation showing improved outcomes, including decreased readmissions, increased treatment compliance, and equity in care. In 2023, the Biden Cancer Moonshot announced new actions to expand access to patient navigation services — services that help guide individuals, caregivers, and families through cancer screening, diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship. In February 2023, the First Lady visited Atrium Health, where Blackley shared how the health system plans to bring patient navigation services to more cancer patients and their loved ones as a result of the Biden-Harris Administration’s actions.\n\n\n\nJazmin Cazares (Uvalde, Texas)\n\nCazares is a leading advocate for gun violence prevention at the state and national level. After her sister Jackie was killed in the shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas, Cazares spent her senior year of high school traveling across the country and sharing Jackie’s story. She spoke alongside March for Our Lives leaders at the Texas State Capitol and testified before lawmakers to advocate for tighter background checks and extreme risk protection order laws. In 2023, Cazares was honored by the First Lady during the first-ever “Girls Leading Change” celebration at the White House.\n\n\n\nKate Cox (Dallas, Texas)\n\nCox is a mother of two from Texas who has experienced the devastating consequences of state abortion bans and courageously spoke out about her experience seeking the care she needed to preserve her health. Cox is one of the first women in 50 years to have to turn to the courts to ask permission to receive the abortion that her doctor recommended. She was ultimately forced to travel out of state for care that she would have been able to receive if the protections of Roe v. Wade were still in effect.\n\n\n\nSamantha Ervin-Upsher (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)\n\nErvin-Upsher is an apprentice with the United Brotherhood of Carpenters Local 432 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She is 23 years old and a mother of two. In 2023, Ervin-Upsher met the First Lady during a visit to Pennsylvania to highlight the Investing in America Workforce Hub in Pittsburgh, an initiative that seeks to build career pathways through high schools, community colleges, and unions to job opportunities fueled by President’s Biden’s investments.\n\n\n\nShawn Fain (Metro Detroit, Michigan)\n\nFain is a 29-year member and the current President of the United Auto Workers (UAW). Hailing from a family of UAW members, Fain got his start with UAW Local Union 1166 as an electrician for Chrysler at the Kokomo Casting Plant in his hometown of Kokomo, Indiana. In September 2023, President Biden joined Fain and UAW workers on the picket line in Belleville, Michigan, making history as the first sitting President to join a picket line. After hard-fought negotiations and a “Stand-Up” strike that inspired workers across the country, the UAW won historic pay increases, greater retirement security, more paid leave, and more dignity and respect. Their efforts also yielded job security commitments from General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis, including a commitment from Stellantis to bring thousands of good-paying UAW jobs back to Belvidere, Illinois. The UAW’s historic contract immediately led non-union automakers to announce double digit pay raises for their U.S. workers – adding further evidence that when unions do well, all workers do well.\n\n\n\nBettie Mae Fikes (Selma, Alabama)\n\nFikes is an American singer and civil rights advocate who was a Bloody Sunday Foot Soldier in Selma, Alabama in 1965. Known as “The Voice of Selma,” Fikes served as a member of Selma’s Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) Freedom Singers. She has performed at Carnegie Hall, Newport Jazz Festival, the Library of Congress, and was featured in the Smithsonian Institute’s Museum of Tolerance exhibition honoring women of the Civil Rights Movement. In 2023, Fikes joined President Biden to commemorate the 58th anniversary of Bloody Sunday in Selma, Alabama. This year’s State of the Union Address falls on the 59th anniversary of Bloody Sunday.\n\n\n\nSteven Hadfield (Matthews, North Carolina)\n\nHadfield has a rare blood cancer and is diabetic—two conditions that require very expensive drugs, including a drug that was selected for the first round of Medicare drug price negotiation. He held several part-time positions because he feared that, if he retired, he would not have sufficient income to pay for the drugs he needs to stay alive. The drug that treats his rare blood cancer costs about $15,000 a month. On top of that, his insulin costs him up to $400 every month. Now, thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, Medicare covers his insulin prescriptions with a $35 copay cap per month. And for his blood cancer medications, this year, his Part D out-of-pocket drug costs are capped at about $3,500 and in 2025, he will benefit even more from the $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket drug costs.\n\n\n\nMayor Garnett L. Johnson (Augusta, Georgia)\n\nJohnson is the Mayor of the City of Augusta, Georgia. In 2023, Augusta was designated by the White House as one of five Investing in America Workforce Hubs, where President Biden’s agenda — including the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act — is driving historic investments and creating good-paying jobs. The Augusta Workforce Hub is led by a partnership between Mayor Johnson and three Augusta regional education institutions focused on training students in growing sectors, such as advanced manufacturing and construction skilled trades, to prepare the next generation for technical jobs in the region. The First Lady was last in Augusta in July and November 2023, to meet with Mayor Johnson and highlight how the local community is working together to expand pathways to careers.\n\n\n\nKeenan Jones (Plymouth, Minnesota)\n\nJones is a public middle school educator in Minnesota’s Twin Cities and a member of Education Minnesota. In April 2023, Jones wrote an email to President Biden to thank him for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which eliminated his remaining student loan debt after 10 years of public service and allowed him to continue his teaching career. Jones is one of the nearly 800,000 teachers, nurses, social workers, servicemembers, and other public servants who have received student loan debt forgiveness since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration.\n\n\n\nNatalie King (Detroit, Michigan)\n\nKing is the founder and CEO of Dunamis Charge, the first-ever African American women-owned electric vehicle charger manufacturing company in the United States. Her company employs over 135 workers and is on track to manufacture 400,000 electric vehicle chargers by 2025. In March 2023, King introduced President Biden at the Small Business Administration’s Women’s Business Summit, where she shared that the Administration’s investments in clean energy and small business owners helped her business thrive throughout the pandemic.\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Ulf Kristersson of Sweden\n\nKristersson is the Prime Minister of Sweden. Sweden is formally joining the NATO Alliance on March 7, 2024, becoming the 32nd Ally. Sweden is a strong democracy with a highly capable military that shares our values and vision for the world. Having Sweden as a NATO Ally will make the United States and our Allies even safer. NATO is the most powerful defensive alliance in the history of the world, and it is as critical today to ensuring the security of our citizens as it was 75 years ago when our Alliance was founded out of the wreckage of World War II.\n\n\n\nGovernor Stephen Roe Lewis (Gu-u-Ki, Sacaton, Arizona)\n\nLewis is serving in his fourth term as governor of the Gila River Indian Community. Under his leadership, he has prioritized bringing innovative solutions to long-term issues confronted by the Community and Indian Country. In partnership with the Biden-Harris Administration, Governor Lewis has revolutionized how Tribal governmental infrastructure is constructed, which led to the completion of the first new schools on the Reservation in over 100 years and the first solar-over-canal project in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n\n\nCommander Shelby Nikitin (Wakefield, Massachusetts)\n\nCommander Nikitin is an officer in the U.S. Navy and recently completed her command tour onboard the USS THOMAS HUDNER. Under her leadership, the ship deployed to protect maritime shipping from illegal, dangerous, and destabilizing Houthi attacks against vessels transiting the Red Sea. For her ship’s actions in this combat zone, Commander Nikitin was awarded the Bronze Star for her extraordinary leadership and bravery in defending lives and protecting the free flow of commerce in one of the world’s most critical waterways.\n\n\n\nJustin Phillips (Indianapolis, Indiana)\n\nPhillips is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Overdose Lifeline, a non-profit dedicated to reducing the stigma of substance use disorder and preventing deaths resulting from opioid and fentanyl overdose. Since starting Overdose Lifeline, Phillips has led the organization through program expansion to meet the growing needs of the population. Phillips worked to pass “Aaron’s Law” in Indiana and focuses her advocacy on expanding access to overdose prevention medications. Aaron’s Law allows individuals access to Narcan without a prescription, thus eliminating barriers to receiving the drug and using it to save lives. The Second Gentleman met Phillips and her daughter, Audrey, in 2023 at an event commemorating International Overdose Awareness Day, where the Administration announced additional federal funds to combat accidental overdoses. Phillips is a special guest of Second Gentleman Douglas Emhoff.\n\n\n\nKameryn Pupunu (Lahaina, Hawaii)\n\nPupunu is a police officer for the county of Maui where he has served for the last five years. In August 2023, his hometown of Lahaina was engulfed in flames during one of the deadliest wildfires in U.S history. Pupunu was one of the many local police officers who performed heroic acts, including saving 15 individuals, from this deadly wildfire. Tragically, Pupunu lost four of his immediate family members to these fires.\n\n\n\nMaria Shriver (Los Angeles, California)\n\nShriver is an author, journalist, and founder of the Women’s Alzheimer’s Movement and Strategic Advisor on Women’s Health and Alzheimer’s at Cleveland Clinic. Shriver works to use her voice and platforms to advance some of our nation’s most pressing issues affecting women and women’s health. In November 2023, Shriver joined the President and the First Lady to announce the first-ever White House Initiative on Women’s Health Research, an effort led by Dr. Biden and the White House Gender Policy Council, to galvanize the federal government and the private and philanthropic sectors to spur innovation, unleash transformative investment to close research gaps, and improve women’s health. Shriver’s advocacy has been integral to the initiative and she continues to advise and collaborate with Dr. Biden.\n\n\n\nDawn Simms (Davis Junction, Illinois)\n\nSimms has been a member of the United Auto Workers (UAW) Local 1268 for more than two decades. She’s a third-generation autoworker on at Belvidere Assembly (IL), where she started work in 1999. When Stellantis idled Belvidere Assembly in February 2023, Simms’ son was in the middle of his sophomore year in high school and forced her into an impossible decision: lose her job or relocate to another plant far away from her home (and either move her son or leave him in Illinois). Thanks to the strength and the solidarity of the UAW members, the UAW-Big Three contract secured a commitment from Stellantis to reopen Belvidere Assembly and bring thousands of good-paying middle-class jobs back to Belvidere, stabilizing her family’s future. Today, she is gainfully employed at Stellantis’ auto distribution center in Belvidere. In November 2023, Simms joined President Biden in Belvidere to highlight the reopening of the assembly plant and the return of thousands of good-paying UAW jobs.\n\n\n\nRashawn Spivey (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)\n\nSpivey is the founder and owner of Hero Plumbing in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His decision to become a plumber was inspired by his mother, who worked for one of the first Black-owned plumbing businesses in Wisconsin. After graduating from a plumbing program at Milwaukee Area Technical College and completing an apprenticeship with Plumbers Local 75, support from his local union enabled Spivey to launch his own plumbing business. Spurred by investments from the Biden-Harris Administration, Spivey expanded his plumbing business to focus on lead pipe replacements. Spivey and his team have replaced more than 825 toxic lead pipes, primarily at local daycare centers, to ensure safer drinking water for his community and protect children from lead poisoning. Through historic levels of funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the American Rescue Plan, the Biden-Harris Administration is working to replace every lead pipe in America in the next decade.\n\n\n\nTiffany Zoeller (Fayetteville, North Carolina)\n\nZoeller is a military spouse and works as a medical coder at Fort Liberty’s Womack Army Medical Center. In June 2023, Zoeller introduced the President at Fort Liberty to announce the Presidential Executive Order on Advancing Economic Security for Military and Veteran Spouses, Military Caregivers, and Survivors. This Executive Order is the most comprehensive set of administrative actions any President has ever taken to support military spouses, and included nearly 20 new actions aimed at enhancing military spouse career stability, employment resources, and career transition assistance. The First Lady, through her Joining Forces initiative, has worked to eliminate barriers to employment and increase economic opportunity for military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors.\n\n###",

Pupunu was one of the many local police&#160;officers&#160;who&#160;performed&#160;heroic acts, including saving&#160;15 individuals, from this deadly wildfire.&#160;Tragically, Pupunu lost four of his immediate family members&#160;to these fires.<br>&#160;<br><strong>Maria Shriver (Los Angeles, California)</strong><br>Shriver is an author, journalist, and founder of the Women&#8217;s Alzheimer&#8217;s Movement and Strategic Advisor on Women&#8217;s Health and Alzheimer&#8217;s at Cleveland Clinic. Shriver works to use her voice and platforms to advance some of our nation&#8217;s most pressing issues affecting women and women&#8217;s health. In November 2023, Shriver joined the President and the First Lady to announce the first-ever White House Initiative on Women&#8217;s Health Research, an effort led by Dr. Biden and the White House Gender Policy Council, to galvanize the federal government and the private and philanthropic sectors to spur innovation, unleash transformative investment to close research gaps, and improve women&#8217;s health. Shriver&#8217;s advocacy has been integral to the initiative and she continues to advise and collaborate with Dr. Biden.<br>&#160;<br><strong>Dawn Simms (Davis Junction, Illinois)</strong><br>Simms has been a member of the United Auto Workers (UAW) Local 1268 for more than two decades. She&#8217;s a third-generation autoworker on at Belvidere Assembly (IL), where she started work in 1999. When Stellantis idled Belvidere Assembly in February 2023, Simms&#8217; son was in the middle of his sophomore year in high school and forced her into an impossible decision: lose her job or relocate to another plant far away from her home (and either move her son or leave him in Illinois). Thanks to the strength and the solidarity of the UAW members, the UAW-Big Three contract secured a commitment from Stellantis to reopen Belvidere Assembly and bring thousands of good-paying middle-class jobs back to Belvidere, stabilizing her family&#8217;s future. Today, she is gainfully employed at Stellantis&#8217; auto distribution center in Belvidere. In November 2023, Simms joined President Biden in Belvidere to highlight the reopening of the assembly plant and the return of thousands of good-paying UAW jobs.<br>&#160;<br><strong>Rashawn Spivey (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)</strong><br>Spivey is the founder and owner of Hero Plumbing in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His decision to become a plumber was inspired by his mother, who worked for one of the first Black-owned plumbing businesses in Wisconsin. After graduating from a plumbing program at Milwaukee Area Technical College and completing an apprenticeship with Plumbers Local 75, support from his local union enabled Spivey to launch his own plumbing business. Spurred by investments from the Biden-Harris Administration, Spivey expanded his plumbing business to focus on lead pipe replacements. Spivey and his team have replaced more than 825 toxic lead pipes, primarily at local daycare centers, to ensure safer drinking water for his community and protect children from lead poisoning. Through historic levels of funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the American Rescue Plan, the Biden-Harris Administration is working to replace every lead pipe in America in the next decade.<br>&#160;<br><strong>Tiffany Zoeller (Fayetteville, North Carolina)</strong><br>Zoeller is a military spouse and works as a medical coder at Fort Liberty&#8217;s Womack Army Medical Center. In June 2023, Zoeller introduced the President at Fort Liberty to announce the Presidential Executive Order on Advancing Economic Security for Military and Veteran Spouses, Military Caregivers, and Survivors. This Executive Order is the most comprehensive set of administrative actions any President has ever taken to support military spouses, and included nearly 20 new actions aimed at enhancing military spouse career stability, employment resources, and career transition assistance. The First Lady, through her Joining Forces initiative, has worked to eliminate barriers to employment and increase economic opportunity for military and veteran families, caregivers, and survivors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">###</p>\n\t\t\t</div>",

                        "newstext": "CNN —\n\nAhead of President Joe Biden’s election-year State of the Union address to Congress, here’s a look at the data behind some of the topics and policies he could bring up Thursday evening.\n\nEconomy is solid, but prices remain sky-high\n\nAfter inflation rose in 2021 and soared for most of 2022, it cooled to more reasonable levels by the end of 2023 and without triggering a recession.\n\nIn January, the unemployment rate held steady at just 3.7%. And stock markets have been rallying since October. The S&P reached a new all-time high and notched its best showing in a year.\n\nStill, Americans are feeling the effects of rising home prices and mortgage rates, putting home ownership and the “American Dream” out of reach for many.\n\nBiden’s student loan debt forgiveness not as big of a dent as planned\n\nThe Biden administration has forgiven $138 billion in student loan debt for 3.9 million borrowers through a variety of programs.\n\nThe president’s broad, one-time student debt cancellation plan, which would have erased $430 billion in total federal debt for borrowers, was struck down by the Supreme Court last year.\n\nA nation divided on abortion rights\n\nAbortion is currently banned or restricted in 21 states, concentrated in the southeastern quadrant of the country. The Supreme Court’s June 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which eliminated a constitutional right to abortion nationwide, has created a patchwork of state laws and an increasingly fragmented abortion landscape.\n\nThe Supreme Court also reentered the abortion debate late last year and is slated to review a Texas lower court’s decision regarding access to medication abortion later this month. The high court could choose to protect full access to the abortion pill, or enforce restrictions such as revoking mail order access.\n\nGun violence continues to shake communities\n\nWith 656 mass shootings recorded, 2023 ranked second for the most mass shootings recorded in a single year in at least a decade. At least 71 mass shootings have been recorded in the United States this year, as of March 6.\n\nForeign aid stalemate\n\nAs the Russia-Ukraine war enters its third year, aid to Ukraine has been a major source of tension between the White House and House Republicans.\n\nIn February, the Senate passed a $95 billion foreign aid package, including $60 billion for Ukraine, but Speaker Mike Johnson has yet to bring it to the House floor for a vote and it’s unclear if he will do so. The Senate’s package also included $14 billion for Israel as the latest Israel-Hamas conflict nears the six-month mark.\n\nProjected drug price relief\n\nThe president is likely to tout what is largely seen as one of Democrats’ key legislative achievements so far, the Inflation Reduction Act, which included a major change to health policy by giving Medicare the power for the first time to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs. While the rollout of this particular change is still in progress, here’s a look at the projected trend of out-of-pocket prescription drug spending for Americans:\n\nCrisis at the border\n\nData on US Customs and Border Protection encounters with migrants at the US-Mexico border show a marked increase from pre-pandemic levels. While this is just one facet of immigration in the United States, the border crisis is a major issue that both Donald Trump and Biden are trading blame over as they head toward their likely general election rematch in November.",

                        "newstext": "SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — A jury convicted a movie weapons supervisor of involuntary manslaughter Wednesday in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer by actor Alec Baldwin during a rehearsal on the set of the Western movie “Rust.”\n\nThe verdict against movie armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed assigned new blame in the October 2021 shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins after an assistant director last year pleaded no contest to negligent handling of a firearm.\n\nGutierrez-Reed also had faced a second charge of tampering with evidence, stemming from accusations that she handed a small bag of possible narcotics to another crew member after the shooting to avoid detection. She was found not guilty on that count.\n\nImmediately after the verdict was read in court, the judge ordered the 26-year-old armorer placed into the custody of deputies. Lead attorney Jason Bowles said afterward that Gutierrez-Reed will appeal the conviction, which carries a penalty of up to 18 months in prison and a $5,000 fine.\n\nSanta Fe-based state district court Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer did not immediately set a sentencing date.\n\nBaldwin, the lead actor and a co-producer on “Rust,” was indicted by a grand jury in January on a charge of involuntary manslaughter. He was pointing a gun at Hutchins on a movie set outside Santa Fe, New Mexico, when the gun went off, killing the cinematographer and wounding director Joel Souza.\n\nThe trial was a preamble to Baldwin’s trial scheduled in July. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nMessages seeking comment about Wednesday’s verdict from Baldwin’s spokeswoman and a lawyer were not immediately returned.\n\nProsecutors said at trial that Gutierrez-Reed unknowingly brought live ammunition onto the movie set, and it remained there for at least 12 days before the fatal shooting, giving the armorer plenty of time to remove it.\n\nIn closing arguments, prosecutor Kari Morrissey described “constant, never-ending safety failures” on the set of “Rust” and Gutierrez-Reed’s “astonishing lack of diligence” with gun safety.\n\n“We end exactly where we began — in the pursuit of justice for Halyna Hutchins,” Morrissey told jurors. “Hannah Gutierrez failed to maintain firearms safety, making a fatal accident willful and foreseeable.”\n\nJury hears closing arguments in trial of armorer over fatal shooting by Alec Baldwin AP correspondent Margie Szaroleta reports on closing arguments in the involuntary manslaughter trial for the armorer on the Alec Baldwin movie “Rust.”\n\nProsecutors also contended that the armorer repeatedly skipped or skimped on standard gun-safety protocols that might have detected the live rounds.\n\n“This was a game of Russian roulette every time an actor had a gun with dummies,” Morrissey said.\n\nAn attorney for Hutchins’ parents and sister issued a statement expressing their satisfaction with Wednesday’s verdict.\n\n“Today was the first trial and conviction in the criminal justice process,” said the statement from Gloria Allred on behalf of parents Olga Solovey and Anatolli Androsovych and Hutchins’ sister, Svetlana Zemko. “We look forward to the justice system continuing to make sure that everyone else who is responsible for Halyna’s death is required to face the legal consequences.”\n\nInside the courtroom Wednesday, Gutierrez-Reed’s mother reacted with dismay at the conviction, bursting into tears and cursing the proceedings as her daughter was led away.\n\nDefense attorneys told jurors that the problems on the set extended far beyond Gutierrez-Reed’s control, including the mishandling of weapons by Baldwin, citing sanctions and findings by state workplace safety investigators.\n\nThe defense also cast doubt on accusations that Gutierrez-Reed brought live rounds to the set and said an Albuquerque-based ammunition supplier was never fully investigated.\n\nJuror Alberto Sanchez said Gutierrez-Reed could have paused work on the set to address safety issues. Jurors concluded she brought live ammunition on set, whether she knew it or not, Sanchez said outside of court after jurors were dismissed.\n\n“Pretty much it was just that (she) never did the safety checks,” said Sanchez, whose work nearby in Los Alamos has involved safety decisions. “Never checked the rounds, to pull them out to shake them. I mean, if she’d have done that this wouldn’t have happened.”\n\nBowles, the defense attorney, had told jurors that no one in the cast and crew thought there were live rounds on set and Gutierrez-Reed could not have foreseen that Baldwin would “go off-script” when he pointed the revolver at Hutchins. Investigators found no video recordings of the shooting.\n\n“It was not in the script for Mr. Baldwin to point the weapon,” Bowles said. “She didn’t know that Mr. Baldwin was going to do what he did.”\n\nTo drive the point home, Bowles played a video outtake from another day in which Baldwin fired a revolver loaded with blanks — including a shot after a director calls “cut.”\n\nOn the day of the shooting, Bowles said, Gutierrez-Reed alone was segregated in a police car away from others, becoming a convenient scapegoat.\n\n“You had a production company on a shoestring budget, an A-list actor that was really running the show,” Bowles said. “At the end, they had somebody they could all blame.”\n\nDozens of witnesses had testified during the 10-day trial, from FBI experts in firearms and crime-scene forensics to a camera dolly operator who described the fatal gunshot and watching Hutchins go flush and lose feeling in her legs before death.\n\nThe prosecution painstakingly assembled photographic evidence it said traced the arrival and spread of live rounds on set and argued that Gutierrez-Reed repeatedly missed opportunities to ensure safety and treated basic gun protocols as optional.\n\nThe defense had cast doubt on the relevance of photographs of ammunition, noting FBI testimony that live rounds can’t be fully distinguished from dummy ones on sight.\n\nProsecutors said six live rounds found on set bear mostly identical characteristics and don’t match live rounds seized from the movie’s supplier in Albuquerque. Defense attorneys said the cluttered supply office was not searched until a month after the shooting, undermining the significance of physical evidence.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the last name of Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer.",

                        "newstext": "A New Mexico jury on Wednesday found Rust armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the fatal 2021 shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of the indie Western. The jury decided the defendant was not guilty of evidence tampering\n\nThe panel of seven women and five men returned their verdict in the criminal case after just a couple hours of deliberation today. The trial of the crew member was two weeks and saw closing arguments this morning.\n\nJudge Mary Marlowe Sommer had Gutierrez-Reed taken into custody almost immediately after the verdict was read out. A sentencing hearing is potentially set for next month. The defense have made it clear they plan to appeal.\n\nThe stepdaughter of famed movie gun coach Thell Reed, relatively inexperienced armorer Gutierrez-Reed was charged with involuntary manslaughter and evidence tampering. She faced up to three years in state prison if found guilty on both charges. With the split verdict, the most Gutierrez-Reed could potentially receive now is about 18 months and a fine of several thousand dollars.\n\nEver since she was charged back in January 2023, the prosecution has claimed Gutierrez-Reed was responsible for live rounds getting on the Rust set and into the gun that Alec Baldwin was holding that fired during rehearsals on the Bonanza Creek set, striking Hutchins and director Joel Souza. In response, the defense has offered various theories over the past two years about how that fatal bullet got there, including sabotage.\n\n“There’s reasonable doubt she had anything to do ultimately with Halyna Hutchins’ death,” main defense lawyer Jason Bowles said today in his closing argument before the jury, the special prosecutors and Sommer. Reiterating language from his opening statement on February 22, Bowles called his client a “convenient scapegoat,” and added: “The buck stops with production … as in any organization, it starts at the top.”\n\nThe prosecution took a different perspective, as expected.\n\n“[Gutierrez-Reed] was negligent, she was careless, she was thoughtless,” Special Prosecutor Kerri Morrissey said today in her closing statement. Proclaiming there is “a mountain of circumstantial evidence” against the defendant, Morrissey added of the defense’s so-called “shotgun approach” strategy: “This is all smoke and mirrors and deflection, they don’t want the truth.”\n\nA visibly distraught Thell Reed was in Santa Fe County courtroom today when the verdict was read out against his stepdaughter. Also in the courtroom, sitting at the back, was Rust ammunition supplier Seth Kenney.\n\nLong at the heart of the mystery of how live rounds got into the gun in Baldwin’s hand, Kenney told the court in his own testimony earlier this week that he believed the 81-year-old Reed wanted to blame him for the accident. “Knowing Thell and having been friends with him for a few years at that point, I know how much he loves his daughter,” Kenney said.\n\nWhat there seemed to be no debate about in this trial was that to save money, producers on the low-budget indie Western had Gutierrez-Reed working as both the armorer and as assistant to props master Sarah Zachery. The latter struck a plea deal last year and testified for the prosecution last week.\n\nA 2022 report by the Occupational Health & Safety Bureau’s New Mexico office determined that Gutierrez-Reed was not provided “time to conduct her duties to the best of her diligence” and required to “focus on other tasks” like working in the props department. Putting the responsibility for the shooting on Rust producers, OSHA handed out a civil penalty to Rust Productions for $136,793, one of the largest such penalties ever levied by the organization. That penalty was reduced to $100,000 early last year after a protest from the producers.\n\nJensen Ackles Instagram\n\nAfter the sentencing of Gutierrez-Reed, the next big move in this tragedy is the July 9-scheduled involuntary manslaughter trial of Rust star-producer Baldwin. Recharged with involuntary manslaughter himself in January and having entered a not guilty plea not long afterward, the multi-Emmy-winning actor was brought up almost as much as the defendant herself in Gutierrez-Reed’s trial.\n\nPotentially looking at 18 months behind bars if found guilty, Baldwin is also fighting a series of civil cases related to the Rust shooting in both California and New Mexico courts.\n\nAlthough the FBI and other gun examiners disagree, Baldwin has been adamant that he did not pull the trigger on the Colt .45 he was holding that fired and killed Hutchins and wounded Souza.\n\nRust the movie was resurrected last year with more filming in Montana, and Baldwin and Souza back on board. The completed film has been on the market looking for a buyer.",

Putting the responsibility for the shooting on Rust producers, OSHA handed out a civil penalty to Rust Productions for $136,793, one of the largest such penalties ever levied by the organization. That penalty was reduced to $100,000 early last year after a protest from the producers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n<img class=\"c-lazy-image__img lrv-u-background-color-grey-lightest lrv-u-width-100p lrv-u-display-block lrv-u-height-auto\" src=\"https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg\" alt=\"\" height=\"563\" width=\"750\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p class=\" lrv-u-font-size-16 lrv-u-font-size-14@mobile-max lrv-a-font-body-m u-font-style-italic lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-font-family-primary u-line-height-20 u-letter-spacing-0 u-line-height-18@mobile-max\"> </p>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJensen Ackles Instagram\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\tAfter the sentencing of  Gutierrez-Reed, the next big move in this tragedy is the July 9-scheduled involuntary manslaughter trial of Rust star-producer Baldwin. <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/01/alec-baldwin-charged-manslaughter-rust-1235798016/\">Recharged with involuntary manslaughter himself</a>&#160;in January and having&#160;<a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/01/alec-baldwin-plea-new-charge-1235810380/\">entered a not guilty plea</a>&#160;not long afterward, the multi-Emmy-winning actor was brought up almost as much as the defendant herself in Gutierrez-Reed&#8217;s trial. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\tPotentially looking at 18 months behind bars if found guilty, Baldwin is also fighting a series of civil cases related to the&#160;Rust&#160;shooting in both California and New Mexico courts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\tAlthough the FBI and other gun examiners disagree, Baldwin has been adamant that he did not pull the trigger on the Colt .45 he was holding that fired and killed Hutchins and wounded Souza.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   \">\n\tRust the movie was resurrected last year with more filming in Montana, and Baldwin and Souza back on board.

                        "publisher": "USA TODAY",
                        "newstext": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday the central bank won’t begin cutting its key interest rate “until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward” its 2% goal, noting the move will likely occur “at some point this year.”\n\nHis comments, in prepared remarks he delivered before the House Financial Services Committee at 10 a.m., echo those he made at the Fed’s last meeting in late January.\n\nIn the text, Powell said inflation “has eased substantially” and he did not mention a recent rebound in monthly price increases that led some economists to push back their forecast for the first rate decrease to later in the year. That could be a positive signal that Fed officials are not overly concerned by the price spike.\n\nResponding to questions from committee members, Powell added, \"because the economy has been so strong we think we can and should be careful\" about slicing rates. He added the Fed wants \"to see more good inflation readings\" to feel confident that the recent pullback in price gains won't stall or reverse.\n\n'Losing my mind'Behind the gaudy job numbers, Americans are struggling to find work\n\nWhat is the inflation rate in 2024?\n\nIn January, inflation overall rose 0.3% while a core measure that excludes volatile food and energy items increased 0.4%, both substantially higher than the recent trend, according to the personal consumption expenditures index, the Fed’s preferred gauge.\n\nBut those readings still pushed down annual inflation to 2.4% and the core yearly measure to 2.8%. Personal consumption expenditures inflation peaked at a 40-year high of 7% in June 2022.\n\nOn Wednesday, Powell said the risks of cutting rates too soon versus waiting too long have become more balanced now that inflation has moderated.\n\n“Reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of progress we have seen in inflation and ultimately require tighter policy to get inflation back to 2%,” Powell said in his prepared testimony. “At the same time reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.”\n\nWhat are interest rates today?\n\nFutures markets now predict the Fed will start lowering its benchmark rate in June and trim it by a quarter percentage point four times, from a 22-year high of 5.25% to 5.5% to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%. From March 2022 to July 2023, the Fed hoisted its federal funds rate from near zero to wrestle down inflation.\n\nWill home interest rates go down in 2024?\n\nLowering the Fed’s key short-term rate would reduce borrowing costs for mortgages, credit cards, auto loans and other types of consumer and business loans, though it would also trim bank savings rates that finally have delivered healthy yields after years of meager returns. The prospect of Fed rate cuts has propelled the stock market to record highs.\n\nWith inflation slowing, the Fed has held its key rate steady for four straight meetings since July. And late last year, Fed officials forecast three rate cuts this year.\n\nIn his testimony, Powell noted that the economy and job market have continued to grow solidly.

That could be a positive signal that Fed officials are not overly concerned by the price spike.</p><p id=\"~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-money-2\" class=\"gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al\"></p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Responding to questions from committee members, Powell added, \"because the economy has been so strong we think we can and should be careful\" about slicing rates. He added the Fed wants \"to see more good inflation readings\" to feel confident that the recent pullback in price gains won't stall or reverse.</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\"><strong class=\"gnt_ar_b_al\">'Losing my mind'</strong><a href=\"/story/money/2024/03/07/job-market-cooling-despite-high-employment-numbers/72846912007/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"gnt_ar_b_a\">Behind the gaudy job numbers, Americans are struggling to find work</a></p><img class=\"gnt_em_img_i\" alt=\"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies to the House Financial Services Committee on the first of two days of semi-annual testimony to Congress in Washington on March 6, 2024.\"><p class=\"gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd\"></p><h2 class=\"gnt_ar_b_h2\">What is the inflation rate in 2024?</h2><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\"><a href=\"/story/money/2024/02/13/inflation-how-its-affecting-consumers-now/72576975007/\" class=\"gnt_ar_b_a\">In January, inflation</a> overall rose 0.3% while a core measure that excludes volatile food and energy items increased 0.4%, both substantially higher than the recent trend, according to the personal consumption expenditures index, the Fed&#8217;s preferred gauge.</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">But those readings still pushed down annual inflation to 2.4% and the core yearly measure to 2.8%. Personal consumption expenditures inflation peaked at a 40-year high of 7% in June 2022.</p><p id=\"~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-money-3\" class=\"gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al\"></p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">On Wednesday, Powell said the risks of cutting rates too soon versus waiting too long have become more balanced now that inflation has moderated.</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">&#8220;Reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of progress we have seen in inflation and ultimately require tighter policy to get inflation back to 2%,&#8221; Powell said in his prepared testimony. &#8220;At the same time reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity and employment.&#8221;</p><h2 class=\"gnt_ar_b_h2\">What are interest rates today?</h2><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Futures markets now predict the Fed will start lowering its benchmark rate in June and trim it by a quarter percentage point four times, from a 22-year high of 5.25% to 5.5% to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%. From March 2022 to July 2023, the Fed hoisted its federal funds rate from near zero to wrestle down inflation.</p><p id=\"~ad-slot-7103-usatoday-native-article_link-money-4\" class=\"gnt_x_sl gnt_x_al\"></p><h2 class=\"gnt_ar_b_h2\">Will home interest rates go down in 2024?</h2><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">Lowering the Fed&#8217;s key short-term rate would reduce borrowing costs for mortgages, credit cards, auto loans and other types of consumer and business loans, though it would also trim bank savings rates that finally have delivered healthy yields after years of meager returns. The prospect of Fed rate cuts has propelled the stock market to record highs.</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">With inflation slowing, the Fed has held its key rate steady for four straight meetings since July. And late last year,&#160;Fed officials forecast three rate cuts this year.</p><p class=\"gnt_ar_b_p\">In his testimony, Powell noted that the economy and <a href=\"/story/money/2024/03/07/job-market-cooling-despite-high-employment-numbers/72846912007/\" class=\"gnt_ar_b_a\">job market have continued to grow solidly</a>.

Read more about how we evaluate products.\n\nIt's hard to expect much from Apple's new M3-equipped MacBook Airs. The 13-inch M2 model, released in 2022, was the first major redesign for Apple's most popular notebook in over a decade. Last year, Apple finally gave its fanatics a big-screen ultraportable notebook with the 15-inch MacBook Air. This week, we've got the same two computers with slightly faster chips. They didn't even get a real launch event from Apple, just a sleepy Monday morning press release. They look the same and are a bit faster than before — what else is there to say?\n\nNow, I'm not saying these aren't great computers. It's just that we've been a bit spoiled by Apple's laptops over the last few years. The M3 MacBook Air marks the inevitable innovation plateau for the company, following the monumental rise of its mobile chips and a complete refresh of its laptops and desktops. It's like hitting cruising altitude after the excitement of takeoff — things are stable and comfortable for Apple and consumers alike.\n\nApple 90 100 13-inch MacBook Air (M3) Apple's latest MacBook Air takes everything we loved about the M2 redesign — a sleeker and lighter case — and adds more power thanks to an M3 chip. Pros Sturdy and sleek design\n\nFast performance thanks to M3 chip\n\nExcellent 13-inch screen\n\nGreat keyboard and trackpad\n\nSolid quad-speaker array Cons Charging and USB-C ports are only on one side $1,099 at Amazon\n\nApple 90 100 15-inch MacBook Air (M3) Apple's big-screen MacBook Air still looks and feels great, and it's faster thanks to an M3 chip. Pros Sturdy and sleek design\n\nFast performance thanks to M3 chip\n\nExcellent 15-inch screen\n\nGreat keyboard and trackpad\n\nSolid six-speaker array Cons Charging and USB-C ports are only on one side $1,299 at Amazon\n\nM3 MacBook Air vs the M2 MacBook Air\n\nEven though they look exactly the same as before, the M3 MacBook Air models have a few new features under the hood. For one, they support dual external displays, but only when their lids are closed. That was something even the M3-equipped 14-inch MacBook Pro lacked at launch, but Apple says the feature is coming to that device via a future software update. Having dual screen support is particularly useful for office workers who may need to drop their computers onto temporary desks, but it could also be helpful for creatives with multiple monitors at home. (If you absolutely need to have your laptop display on alongside two or more external monitors, you'll have to opt for a MacBook Pro with an M3 Pro or Max chip instead.)\n\nBoth new MacBook Air models also support Wi-Fi 6E, an upgrade over the previous Wi-Fi 6 standard with faster speeds and dramatically lower latency. You'll need a Wi-Fi 6E router to actually see those benefits, though. According to Intel, Wi-Fi 6E's ability to tap into seven 160MHz channels helps it avoid congested Wi-Fi 6 spectrum. Basically, you may actually be able to see gigabit speeds more often. (With my AT&T gigabit fiber connection and Wi-Fi 6 gateway, I saw download speeds of around 350 Mbps and uploads ran between 220 Mbps and 320 Mbps on both systems from my basement office. Both upload and download speeds leapt to 700 Mbps when I was on the same floor as the gateway.)\n\nPhoto by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget\n\nDesign and weight\n\nTwo years after the 13-inch M2 MacBook Air debuted, the M3 follow-up is just as sleek and attractive. It seems impossibly thin for a notebook, measuring 0.44 inches thick, and is fairly light at 2.7 pounds. We've seen ultraportables like LG's Gram and the ZenBook S13 OLED that are both lighter and thinner than Apple's hardware, but the MacBook Air still manages to feel like a more premium package. Its unibody aluminum case feels as smooth a river stone yet as sturdy as a boulder. It's a computer I simply love to touch.\n\nPhoto by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget\n\nThe 15-inch M3 MacBook Air is similarly thin, but clocks in half a pound heavier at 3.2 pounds. It's still relatively light for its size, but the additional bulk makes it feel more unwieldy than the 13-inch model. I can easily slip either MacBook Air model into a tote bag when running out to grab my kids from school, but the larger model’s length makes it more annoying to carry.\n\nFor some users, though, that extra heft will be worth it. The bigger MacBook Air sports a 15.3-inch Liquid Retina screen with a sharp 2,880 by 1,864 (224 pixels per inch) resolution, making it better suited for multitasking with multiple windows or working in media editing apps. It's also a better fit for older or visually impaired users, who may have to scale up their displays to make them more readable. (This is something I've noticed while shopping for computers for my parents and other older relatives. 13-inch laptops inevitably become hard to work on, unless you're always wearing bifocals.)\n\nWhile I'm impressed that Apple finally has a large, consumer-focused laptop in its lineup, I still prefer the 13-inch MacBook Air. I spend most of my day writing, Slacking with colleagues, editing photos and talking with companies over video conferencing apps, all of which are easy to do on a smaller screen. If I was directly editing more episodes of the Engadget Podcast, or chopping up video on my own, though, I'd bump up to the 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M3 Pro chip. Even then, I wouldn't have much need for a significantly larger screen.\n\nA lonely headphone jack that could use a USB-C companion. (Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget)\n\nIt's understandable why Apple wouldn't want to tweak the Air's design too much, given that it was just redone a few years ago. Still, I'd love to see a USB-C port on the right side of the machine, just to make charging easier in every location. But I suppose I should just be happy Apple hasn't removed the headphone jack, something that's happening all too frequently in new 13-inch notebooks, like the XPS 13.\n\nHardware\n\nFor our testing, Apple sent the \"midnight\" 13-inch MacBook Air (which is almost jet black and features a fingerprint-resistant coating that actually works), as well as the silver 15-inch model. Both computers were powered by an M3 chip with a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. While these MacBooks start at $1,099 and $1,299, respectively, the configurations we tested cost $400 more. Keep that in mind if you're paying attention to our benchmarks, as you'll definitely see lower figures on the base models. (The cheapest 13-inch offering only has 8GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD and an 8-core GPU, while the entry-level 15-inch unit has the same RAM and storage, along with a 10-core GPU.)\n\n\n\n\n\nGeekbench 6 CPU Geekbench 6 GPU Cinebench R23 3DMark Wildlife Extreme Apple MacBook Air 13-inch (M3, 2024) 3,190/12,102 30,561 1,894/9,037 8,310 Apple MacBook Air 15-inch (M3, 2024) 3,187/12,033 30,556 1,901/9,733 8,253 Apple MacBook Air 13-inch (M2, 2022) 2,570/9,650 25,295 1,576/7,372 6,761 Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M3, 2023) 3,142/11,902 30,462 1,932/10,159 8,139\n\nM3 chip performance\n\nI didn't expect to see a huge performance boost on either MacBook Air, but our benchmarks ended up surprising me. Both laptops scored around 300 points higher in the Cinebench R23 single-core test, compared to the M2 MacBook Air. And when it came to the more strenuous multi-core CPU test, the 13-inch M3 Air was around 1,700 points faster, while the 15-inch model was around 2,400 points faster. (Since both machines are fan-less, there's a good chance the larger case of the 15-inch Air allows for slightly better performance under load.)\n\nThere was a more noticeable difference in Geekbench 6, where the M3 models were around 40 percent faster than before. Apple is touting more middling improvements over the M2 chips — 17 percent faster single-core performance, 21 percent speedier multi-core workloads and 15 percent better GPU workloads — but it's nice to see areas where performance is even better. Really, though, these aren't machines meant to replace M2 systems — the better comparisons are how they measure up to nearly four-year-old M1 Macs or even creakier Intel models. Apple claims the M3 chip is up to 60 percent faster than the M1, but in my testing I saw just a 35 percent speed bump in Cinebench's R23 multi-core test.\n\nWhen it comes to real-world performance, I didn't notice a huge difference between either M3-equipped MacBook Air, compared to the M2 model I've been using for the past few years. Apps load just as quickly, multitasking isn't noticeably faster (thank goodness they have 16GB of RAM), and even photo editing isn't significantly speedier. This is a good time to point out that the M2 MacBook Air is still a fine machine, and it's an even better deal now thanks to a lower $999 starting price. As we've said, the best thing about the existence of the M3 Airs is that they've made the M2 models cheaper. You'll surely find some good deals from stores clearing out older stock and refurbished units, as well as existing owners selling off their M2 machines.\n\nGaming and productivity work\n\nI'll give the M3 MacBook Airs this: they're noticeably faster for gaming. I was able to run Lies of P in 1080p+ (1,920 by 1,200) with high graphics settings and see a smooth 60fps most of the time. It occasionally dipped into the low-50fps range, but that didn't affect the game's playability much. The director's cut of Death Stranding was also smooth and easy to play at that resolution, so long as I didn't crank up the graphics settings too much. It's nice to have the option for some serious games on Macs for once. And if you want more variety, you can also stream high-end games over Xbox's cloud streaming or NVIDIA's GeForce Now.\n\nIn addition to being a bit faster than before, the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs are simply nice computers to use. Their 500-nit screens support HDR and are bright to use outdoors in sunlight. While they're not as impressive as the ProMotion MiniLED displays on the MacBook Pros, they'll get the job done for most users. Apple's quad and six-speaker arrays are also best-in-class, and the 1080p webcams on both computers are perfect for video conferencing (especially when paired with Apple's camera tweaks for brightness and background blurring). And I can’t say enough good things about the MacBook Air’s responsive keyboard and smooth trackpad – I wish every laptop used them.\n\nPhoto by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget\n\nBattery\n\nUnfortunately, the short turn-around time for this review prevented me from running a complete battery test for these computers. At the moment, though, I can say that both machines only used up 40 percent of battery life while playing a 4K fullscreen video at full brightness for over 10 hours. Apple claims they'll play an Apple TV video for up to 18 hours, as well as browse the web wirelessly for up to 15 hours. My testing shows they'll definitely last far more than a typical workday. (I would often go three days without needing to charge the 13-inch M2 MacBook Air. Based on what I've seen so far, I expect similar performance from the M3 models.)\n\nPhoto by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget\n\nWrap-up\n\nThere aren’t any major surprises with the 13-inch and 15-inch M3 MacBook Air, but after years of continual upgrades, that’s to be expected. They’re great computers with excellent performance, gorgeous screens and incredible battery life. And best of all, their introduction also pushes down the prices of the still-great M2 models, making them an even better deal.",

I can easily slip either MacBook Air model into a tote bag when running out to grab my kids from school, but the larger model&#8217;s length makes it more annoying to carry.</p><p>For some users, though, that extra heft will be worth it. The bigger MacBook Air sports a 15.3-inch Liquid Retina screen with a sharp 2,880 by 1,864 (224 pixels per inch) resolution, making it better suited for multitasking with multiple windows or working in media editing apps. It's also a better fit for older or visually impaired users, who may have to scale up their displays to make them more readable. (This is something I've noticed while shopping for computers for my parents and other older relatives. 13-inch laptops inevitably become hard to work on, unless you're always wearing bifocals.)</p><p>While I'm impressed that Apple finally has a large, consumer-focused laptop in its lineup, I still prefer the 13-inch MacBook Air. I spend most of my day writing, Slacking with colleagues, editing photos and talking with companies over video conferencing apps, all of which are easy to do on a smaller screen. If I was directly editing more episodes of the Engadget Podcast, or chopping up video on my own, though, I'd bump up to the 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M3 Pro chip. Even then, I wouldn't have much need for a significantly larger screen.</p><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"MacBook Air M3 13-inch and 15-inch headphone jack\"><img alt=\"MacBook Air M3 13-inch and 15-inch headphone jack\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/t5AEMTNp3Yv623AUsm_uCQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/e1549ee0-dc14-11ee-b9f9-eaca1c63e3b5\" class=\"caas-img\"><p class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\">A lonely headphone jack that could use a USB-C companion.<p class=\"caption-credit\"> (Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget)</p></p><p>It's understandable why Apple wouldn't want to tweak the Air's design too much, given that it was just redone a few years ago.

But I suppose I should just be happy Apple hasn't removed the headphone jack, something that's happening all too frequently in new 13-inch notebooks, like the XPS 13.</p><h2>Hardware</h2><p>For our testing, Apple sent the \"midnight\" 13-inch MacBook Air (which is almost jet black and features a fingerprint-resistant coating that actually works), as well as the silver 15-inch model. Both computers were powered by an M3 chip with a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. While these MacBooks start at $1,099 and $1,299, respectively, the configurations we tested cost $400 more. Keep that in mind if you're paying attention to our benchmarks, as you'll definitely see lower figures on the base models. (The cheapest 13-inch offering only has 8GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD and an 8-core GPU, while the entry-level 15-inch unit has the same RAM and storage, along with a 10-core GPU.)</p><p><br></p><p>Geekbench 6 CPU</p><p>Geekbench 6 GPU</p><p>Cinebench R23</p><p>3DMark Wildlife Extreme</p><p>Apple MacBook Air 13-inch (M3, 2024)</p><p>3,190/12,102</p><p>30,561</p><p>1,894/9,037</p><p>8,310</p><p>Apple MacBook Air 15-inch (M3, 2024)</p><p>3,187/12,033</p><p>30,556</p><p>1,901/9,733</p><p>8,253</p><p>Apple MacBook Air 13-inch (M2, 2022)</p><p>2,570/9,650</p><p>25,295</p><p>1,576/7,372</p><p>6,761</p><p>Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M3, 2023)</p><p>3,142/11,902</p><p>30,462</p><p>1,932/10,159</p><p>8,139</p><h2>M3 chip performance</h2><p>I didn't expect to see a huge performance boost on either MacBook Air, but our benchmarks ended up surprising me. Both laptops scored around 300 points higher in the Cinebench R23 single-core test, compared to the M2 MacBook Air. And when it came to the more strenuous multi-core CPU test, the 13-inch M3 Air was around 1,700 points faster, while the 15-inch model was around 2,400 points faster. (Since both machines are fan-less, there's a good chance the larger case of the 15-inch Air allows for slightly better performance under load.)</p><p>There was a more noticeable difference in Geekbench 6, where the M3 models were around 40 percent faster than before. Apple is touting more middling improvements over the M2 chips &#8212; 17 percent faster single-core performance, 21 percent speedier multi-core workloads and 15 percent better GPU workloads &#8212; but it's nice to see areas where performance is even better. Really, though, these aren't machines meant to replace M2 systems &#8212; the better comparisons are how they measure up to nearly four-year-old M1 Macs or even creakier Intel models. Apple claims the M3 chip is up to 60 percent faster than the M1, but in my testing I saw just a 35 percent speed bump in Cinebench's R23 multi-core test.</p><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"MacBook Air M3 15-inch front view\"><img alt=\"MacBook Air M3 15-inch front view\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TlusITLbpoEMvXHlSO8aVA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0Mg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/e1642f43-dc14-11ee-9bf7-91dd2b8e9ce2\" class=\"caas-img\"><p>When it comes to real-world performance, I didn't notice a huge difference between either M3-equipped MacBook Air, compared to the M2 model I've been using for the past few years. Apps load just as quickly, multitasking isn't noticeably faster (thank goodness they have 16GB of RAM), and even photo editing isn't significantly speedier. This is a good time to point out that the M2 MacBook Air is still a fine machine, and it's an even better deal now thanks to a lower $999 starting price. As we've said, the best thing about the existence of the M3 Airs is that they've <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-best-thing-about-the-m3-macbook-air-is-the-m2-macbook-air-144543065.html\" class=\"link \">made the M2 models cheaper</a>. You'll surely find some good deals from stores clearing out older stock and refurbished units, as well as existing owners selling off their M2 machines.</p><h2>Gaming and productivity work</h2><p>I'll give the M3 MacBook Airs this: they're noticeably faster for gaming. I was able to run Lies of P in 1080p+ (1,920 by 1,200) with high graphics settings and see a smooth 60fps most of the time. It occasionally dipped into the low-50fps range, but that didn't affect the game's playability much. The director's cut of Death Stranding was also smooth and easy to play at that resolution, so long as I didn't crank up the graphics settings too much. It's nice to have the option for some serious games on Macs for once. And if you want more variety, you can also stream high-end games over Xbox's cloud streaming or NVIDIA's GeForce Now.</p><p>In addition to being a bit faster than before, the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs are simply nice computers to use. Their 500-nit screens support HDR and are bright to use outdoors in sunlight. While they're not as impressive as the ProMotion MiniLED displays on the MacBook Pros, they'll get the job done for most users. Apple's quad and six-speaker arrays are also best-in-class, and the 1080p webcams on both computers are perfect for video conferencing (especially when paired with Apple's camera tweaks for brightness and background blurring). And I can&#8217;t say enough good things about the MacBook Air&#8217;s responsive keyboard and smooth trackpad &#8211; I wish every laptop used them.</p><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"MacBook Air M3 13-inch from the top\"><img alt=\"MacBook Air M3 13-inch from the top\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/27KQudvyFsvkUde.omEqrg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYwNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/e15ae070-dc14-11ee-b9e7-fd0413cbdf8a\" class=\"caas-img\"><p class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><p class=\"caption-credit\"> Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</p></p><h2>Battery</h2><p>Unfortunately, the short turn-around time for this review prevented me from running a complete battery test for these computers. At the moment, though, I can say that both machines only used up 40 percent of battery life while playing a 4K fullscreen video at full brightness for over 10 hours. Apple claims they'll play an Apple TV video for up to 18 hours, as well as browse the web wirelessly for up to 15 hours. My testing shows they'll definitely last far more than a typical workday. (I would often go three days without needing to charge the 13-inch M2 MacBook Air. Based on what I've seen so far, I expect similar performance from the M3 models.)</p><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"MacBook Air M3 13-inch top down\"><img alt=\"MacBook Air M3 13-inch top down\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7YmYOr7E5oKT3CheD0gjfw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYyMg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/e154ed00-dc14-11ee-bb5c-0061ac82ee6c\" class=\"caas-img\"><p class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><p class=\"caption-credit\"> Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</p></p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>There aren&#8217;t any major surprises with the 13-inch and 15-inch M3 MacBook Air, but after years of continual upgrades, that&#8217;s to be expected.

The 13-inch M2 model, released in 2022, was the first major redesign for Apple's most popular notebook in over a decade. Last year, Apple finally gave its fanatics a big-screen ultraportable notebook with the 15-inch MacBook Air. This week, we've got the same two computers with slightly faster chips. They didn't even get a real launch event from Apple, just a sleepy Monday morning press release. They look the same and are a bit faster than before — what else is there to say?\n\nNow, I'm not saying these aren't great computers. It's just that we've been a bit spoiled by Apple's laptops over the last few years. The M3 MacBook Air marks the inevitable innovation plateau for the company, following the monumental rise of its mobile chips and a complete refresh of its laptops and desktops. It's like hitting cruising altitude after the excitement of takeoff — things are stable and comfortable for Apple and consumers alike.\n\nApple 90 100 13-inch MacBook Air (M3) Apple's latest MacBook Air takes everything we loved about the M2 redesign — a sleeker and lighter case — and adds more power thanks to an M3 chip.

Both computers were powered by an M3 chip with a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. While these MacBooks start at $1,099 and $1,299, respectively, the configurations we tested cost $400 more. Keep that in mind if you're paying attention to our benchmarks, as you'll definitely see lower figures on the base models. (The cheapest 13-inch offering only has 8GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD and an 8-core GPU, while the entry-level 15-inch unit has the same RAM and storage, along with a 10-core GPU.)\n\n\n\n\n\nGeekbench 6 CPU Geekbench 6 GPU Cinebench R23 3DMark Wildlife Extreme Apple MacBook Air 13-inch (M3, 2024) 3,190/12,102 30,561 1,894/9,037 8,310 Apple MacBook Air 15-inch (M3, 2024) 3,187/12,033 30,556 1,901/9,733 8,253 Apple MacBook Air 13-inch (M2, 2022) 2,570/9,650 25,295 1,576/7,372 6,761 Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M3, 2023) 3,142/11,902 30,462 1,932/10,159 8,139\n\nM3 chip performance\n\nI didn't expect to see a huge performance boost on either MacBook Air, but our benchmarks ended up surprising me. Both laptops scored around 300 points higher in the Cinebench R23 single-core test, compared to the M2 MacBook Air. And when it came to the more strenuous multi-core CPU test, the 13-inch M3 Air was around 1,700 points faster, while the 15-inch model was around 2,400 points faster. (Since both machines are fan-less, there's a good chance the larger case of the 15-inch Air allows for slightly better performance under load.)\n\nThere was a more noticeable difference in Geekbench 6, where the M3 models were around 40 percent faster than before. Apple is touting more middling improvements over the M2 chips — 17 percent faster single-core performance, 21 percent speedier multi-core workloads and 15 percent better GPU workloads — but it's nice to see areas where performance is even better. Really, though, these aren't machines meant to replace M2 systems — the better comparisons are how they measure up to nearly four-year-old M1 Macs or even creakier Intel models. Apple claims the M3 chip is up to 60 percent faster than the M1, but in my testing I saw just a 35 percent speed bump in Cinebench's R23 multi-core test.\n\nWhen it comes to real-world performance, I didn't notice a huge difference between either M3-equipped MacBook Air, compared to the M2 model I've been using for the past few years. Apps load just as quickly, multitasking isn't noticeably faster (thank goodness they have 16GB of RAM), and even photo editing isn't significantly speedier. This is a good time to point out that the M2 MacBook Air is still a fine machine, and it's an even better deal now thanks to a lower $999 starting price. As we've said, the best thing about the existence of the M3 Airs is that they've made the M2 models cheaper. You'll surely find some good deals from stores clearing out older stock and refurbished units, as well as existing owners selling off their M2 machines.\n\nGaming and productivity work\n\nI'll give the M3 MacBook Airs this: they're noticeably faster for gaming. I was able to run Lies of P in 1080p+ (1,920 by 1,200) with high graphics settings and see a smooth 60fps most of the time. It occasionally dipped into the low-50fps range, but that didn't affect the game's playability much. The director's cut of Death Stranding was also smooth and easy to play at that resolution, so long as I didn't crank up the graphics settings too much. It's nice to have the option for some serious games on Macs for once. And if you want more variety, you can also stream high-end games over Xbox's cloud streaming or NVIDIA's GeForce Now.\n\nIn addition to being a bit faster than before, the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs are simply nice computers to use. Their 500-nit screens support HDR and are bright to use outdoors in sunlight. While they're not as impressive as the ProMotion MiniLED displays on the MacBook Pros, they'll get the job done for most users. Apple's quad and six-speaker arrays are also best-in-class, and the 1080p webcams on both computers are perfect for video conferencing (especially when paired with Apple's camera tweaks for brightness and background blurring). And I can’t say enough good things about the MacBook Air’s responsive keyboard and smooth trackpad – I wish every laptop used them.\n\nPhoto by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget\n\nBattery\n\nUnfortunately, the short turn-around time for this review prevented me from running a complete battery test for these computers. At the moment, though, I can say that both machines only used up 40 percent of battery life while playing a 4K fullscreen video at full brightness for over 10 hours. Apple claims they'll play an Apple TV video for up to 18 hours, as well as browse the web wirelessly for up to 15 hours. My testing shows they'll definitely last far more than a typical workday. (I would often go three days without needing to charge the 13-inch M2 MacBook Air. Based on what I've seen so far, I expect similar performance from the M3 models.)\n\nPhoto by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget\n\nWrap-up\n\nThere aren’t any major surprises with the 13-inch and 15-inch M3 MacBook Air, but after years of continual upgrades, that’s to be expected. They’re great computers with excellent performance, gorgeous screens and incredible battery life. And best of all, their introduction also pushes down the prices of the still-great M2 models, making them an even better deal.",

have a few new features under the hood. For one, they support dual external displays, but only when their lids are closed. That was something even the M3-equipped 14-inch MacBook Pro lacked at launch, but Apple says the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-m3-macbook-pro-is-getting-multi-display-support-just-like-the-air-193844930.html\" class=\"link \">feature is coming to that device </a>via a future software update. Having dual screen support is particularly useful for office workers who may need to drop their computers onto temporary desks, but it could also be helpful for creatives with multiple monitors at home. (If you absolutely need to have your laptop display on alongside two or more external monitors, you'll have to opt for a MacBook Pro with an M3 Pro or Max chip instead.)</p><p>Both new MacBook Air models also support Wi-Fi 6E, an upgrade over the previous Wi-Fi 6 standard with faster speeds and dramatically lower latency. You'll need a Wi-Fi 6E router to actually see those benefits, though. <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=2d327af4-8b42-4ff1-a409-ae7bf906e9e9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Intel&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnRlbC5jb20vY29udGVudC93d3cvdXMvZW4vcHJvZHVjdHMvZG9jcy93aXJlbGVzcy93aS1maS02ZS5odG1sIzp-OnRleHQ9Q29tcGFyaW5nJTIwV2klMkRGaSUyMDZFJTIwYW5kJTIwV2klMkRGaSUyMDYmdGV4dD1UaGUlMjBtb3N0JTIwaW1wYWN0ZnVsJTIwZGlmZmVyZW5jZSUyMGlzLCUyQyUyMDUlMkMlMjBhbmQlMjA2JTIwZGV2aWNlcy4iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjAzOTRjMmM0LWUzYzItNDQyMy1hYTNjLTkyNjA2NjNhNjIyZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZdQYFwhHLNMVuiA-a7RmnPvlVbiFgxw8zpEbFhpjlNV&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.intel.com%2Fcontent%2Fwww%2Fus%2Fen%2Fproducts%2Fdocs%2Fwireless%2Fwi-fi-6e.html%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DComparing%2520Wi%252DFi%25206E%2520and%2520Wi%252DFi%25206%26text%3DThe%2520most%2520impactful%2520difference%2520is%2C%252C%25205%252C%2520and%25206%2520devices.\" class=\"link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">According to Intel</a>, Wi-Fi 6E's ability to tap into seven 160MHz channels helps it avoid congested Wi-Fi 6 spectrum.

It seems impossibly thin for a notebook, measuring 0.44 inches thick, and is fairly light at 2.7 pounds. We've seen ultraportables like LG's Gram and the <a href=\"https://press.asus.com/news/asus-zenbook-s-13-oled-2024-intel-core-ultra-7/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link \">ZenBook S13 OLED</a> that are both lighter and thinner than Apple's hardware, but the MacBook Air still manages to feel like a more premium package. Its unibody aluminum case feels as smooth a river stone yet as sturdy as a boulder. It's a computer I simply love to touch.</p><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"Holding the MacBook Air M3 13-inch \"><img alt=\"Holding the MacBook Air M3 13-inch \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9yxraCgxXOg1QFXAy3glpw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU1Ng--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/e1642f42-dc14-11ee-a3ef-d9d46bef1315\" class=\"caas-img\"><p class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><p class=\"caption-credit\"> Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</p></p><p>The 15-inch M3 MacBook Air is similarly thin, but clocks in half a pound heavier at 3.2 pounds. It's still relatively light for its size, but the additional bulk makes it feel more unwieldy than the 13-inch model. I can easily slip either MacBook Air model into a tote bag when running out to grab my kids from school, but the larger model&#8217;s length makes it more annoying to carry.</p><p>For some users, though, that extra heft will be worth it. The bigger MacBook Air sports a 15.3-inch Liquid Retina screen with a sharp 2,880 by 1,864 (224 pixels per inch) resolution, making it better suited for multitasking with multiple windows or working in media editing apps. It's also a better fit for older or visually impaired users, who may have to scale up their displays to make them more readable. (This is something I've noticed while shopping for computers for my parents and other older relatives. 13-inch laptops inevitably become hard to work on, unless you're always wearing bifocals.)</p><p>While I'm impressed that Apple finally has a large, consumer-focused laptop in its lineup, I still prefer the 13-inch MacBook Air. I spend most of my day writing, Slacking with colleagues, editing photos and talking with companies over video conferencing apps, all of which are easy to do on a smaller screen. If I was directly editing more episodes of the Engadget Podcast, or chopping up video on my own, though, I'd bump up to the 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M3 Pro chip. Even then, I wouldn't have much need for a significantly larger screen.</p><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"MacBook Air M3 13-inch and 15-inch headphone jack\"><img alt=\"MacBook Air M3 13-inch and 15-inch headphone jack\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/t5AEMTNp3Yv623AUsm_uCQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/e1549ee0-dc14-11ee-b9f9-eaca1c63e3b5\" class=\"caas-img\"><p class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\">A lonely headphone jack that could use a USB-C companion.<p class=\"caption-credit\"> (Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget)</p></p><p>It's understandable why Apple wouldn't want to tweak the Air's design too much, given that it was just redone a few years ago. Still, I'd love to see a USB-C port on the right side of the machine, just to make charging easier in every location. But I suppose I should just be happy Apple hasn't removed the headphone jack, something that's happening all too frequently in new 13-inch notebooks, like the XPS 13.</p><h2>Hardware</h2><p>For our testing, Apple sent the \"midnight\" 13-inch MacBook Air (which is almost jet black and features a fingerprint-resistant coating that actually works), as well as the silver 15-inch model. Both computers were powered by an M3 chip with a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. While these MacBooks start at $1,099 and $1,299, respectively, the configurations we tested cost $400 more. Keep that in mind if you're paying attention to our benchmarks, as you'll definitely see lower figures on the base models. (The cheapest 13-inch offering only has 8GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD and an 8-core GPU, while the entry-level 15-inch unit has the same RAM and storage, along with a 10-core GPU.)</p><p><br></p><p>Geekbench 6 CPU</p><p>Geekbench 6 GPU</p><p>Cinebench R23</p><p>3DMark Wildlife Extreme</p><p>Apple MacBook Air 13-inch (M3, 2024)</p><p>3,190/12,102</p><p>30,561</p><p>1,894/9,037</p><p>8,310</p><p>Apple MacBook Air 15-inch (M3, 2024)</p><p>3,187/12,033</p><p>30,556</p><p>1,901/9,733</p><p>8,253</p><p>Apple MacBook Air 13-inch (M2, 2022)</p><p>2,570/9,650</p><p>25,295</p><p>1,576/7,372</p><p>6,761</p><p>Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M3, 2023)</p><p>3,142/11,902</p><p>30,462</p><p>1,932/10,159</p><p>8,139</p><h2>M3 chip performance</h2><p>I didn't expect to see a huge performance boost on either MacBook Air, but our benchmarks ended up surprising me. Both laptops scored around 300 points higher in the Cinebench R23 single-core test, compared to the M2 MacBook Air. And when it came to the more strenuous multi-core CPU test, the 13-inch M3 Air was around 1,700 points faster, while the 15-inch model was around 2,400 points faster. (Since both machines are fan-less, there's a good chance the larger case of the 15-inch Air allows for slightly better performance under load.)</p><p>There was a more noticeable difference in Geekbench 6, where the M3 models were around 40 percent faster than before. Apple is touting more middling improvements over the M2 chips &#8212; 17 percent faster single-core performance, 21 percent speedier multi-core workloads and 15 percent better GPU workloads &#8212; but it's nice to see areas where performance is even better. Really, though, these aren't machines meant to replace M2 systems &#8212; the better comparisons are how they measure up to nearly four-year-old M1 Macs or even creakier Intel models. Apple claims the M3 chip is up to 60 percent faster than the M1, but in my testing I saw just a 35 percent speed bump in Cinebench's R23 multi-core test.</p><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"MacBook Air M3 15-inch front view\"><img alt=\"MacBook Air M3 15-inch front view\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TlusITLbpoEMvXHlSO8aVA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0Mg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/e1642f43-dc14-11ee-9bf7-91dd2b8e9ce2\" class=\"caas-img\"><p>When it comes to real-world performance, I didn't notice a huge difference between either M3-equipped MacBook Air, compared to the M2 model I've been using for the past few years. Apps load just as quickly, multitasking isn't noticeably faster (thank goodness they have 16GB of RAM), and even photo editing isn't significantly speedier. This is a good time to point out that the M2 MacBook Air is still a fine machine, and it's an even better deal now thanks to a lower $999 starting price. As we've said, the best thing about the existence of the M3 Airs is that they've <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-best-thing-about-the-m3-macbook-air-is-the-m2-macbook-air-144543065.html\" class=\"link \">made the M2 models cheaper</a>. You'll surely find some good deals from stores clearing out older stock and refurbished units, as well as existing owners selling off their M2 machines.</p><h2>Gaming and productivity work</h2><p>I'll give the M3 MacBook Airs this: they're noticeably faster for gaming. I was able to run Lies of P in 1080p+ (1,920 by 1,200) with high graphics settings and see a smooth 60fps most of the time. It occasionally dipped into the low-50fps range, but that didn't affect the game's playability much. The director's cut of Death Stranding was also smooth and easy to play at that resolution, so long as I didn't crank up the graphics settings too much. It's nice to have the option for some serious games on Macs for once. And if you want more variety, you can also stream high-end games over Xbox's cloud streaming or NVIDIA's GeForce Now.</p><p>In addition to being a bit faster than before, the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs are simply nice computers to use. Their 500-nit screens support HDR and are bright to use outdoors in sunlight. While they're not as impressive as the ProMotion MiniLED displays on the MacBook Pros, they'll get the job done for most users. Apple's quad and six-speaker arrays are also best-in-class, and the 1080p webcams on both computers are perfect for video conferencing (especially when paired with Apple's camera tweaks for brightness and background blurring). And I can&#8217;t say enough good things about the MacBook Air&#8217;s responsive keyboard and smooth trackpad &#8211; I wish every laptop used them.</p><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"MacBook Air M3 13-inch from the top\"><img alt=\"MacBook Air M3 13-inch from the top\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/27KQudvyFsvkUde.omEqrg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYwNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/e15ae070-dc14-11ee-b9e7-fd0413cbdf8a\" class=\"caas-img\"><p class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><p class=\"caption-credit\"> Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</p></p><h2>Battery</h2><p>Unfortunately, the short turn-around time for this review prevented me from running a complete battery test for these computers. At the moment, though, I can say that both machines only used up 40 percent of battery life while playing a 4K fullscreen video at full brightness for over 10 hours. Apple claims they'll play an Apple TV video for up to 18 hours, as well as browse the web wirelessly for up to 15 hours. My testing shows they'll definitely last far more than a typical workday. (I would often go three days without needing to charge the 13-inch M2 MacBook Air. Based on what I've seen so far, I expect similar performance from the M3 models.)</p><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"MacBook Air M3 13-inch top down\"><img alt=\"MacBook Air M3 13-inch top down\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7YmYOr7E5oKT3CheD0gjfw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYyMg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/e154ed00-dc14-11ee-bb5c-0061ac82ee6c\" class=\"caas-img\"><p class=\"caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image\"><p class=\"caption-credit\"> Photo by Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</p></p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>There aren&#8217;t any major surprises with the 13-inch and 15-inch M3 MacBook Air, but after years of continual upgrades, that&#8217;s to be expected. They&#8217;re great computers with excellent performance, gorgeous screens and incredible battery life. And best of all, their introduction also pushes down the prices of the still-great M2 models, making them an even better deal.</p></div>",

But at least I can tell these two apart.\n\nThe chassis of the 13-inch and 15-inch Air M3s are the same as their M2 predecessors: same wedgeless design, same dimensions and weight, same colorway options — same everything. If the two were side by side, you probably wouldn’t be able to tell which ones have an M2 chip and which ones have an M3.\n\nYou’d have to fire them up and run some benchmarks to tell the difference from the M2 models. Based on my time with the MacBook Pro 14 M3, I expect the Air M3s to have about a 10 to 15 percent performance increase over the M2 Airs and equivalent (if not identical) performance to the MacBook Pro 14 M3.

From configuration options to battery life, little has changed, except the M3 models can finally power two external displays with the laptop closed. The M1 and M2 Airs could only use one, and the lid had to be open. (The base-model 14-inch MacBook Pro M3 will be able to run two external displays, too, after a software update — no word on the M1 and M2 Airs, though.)\n\nApple says the midnight colorway should be less prone to fingerprints. So far, that does not seem to be the case. Photo by Joanna Nelius / The Verge\n\nSame goes for the 15-inch MacBook Air, although its six-speaker sound system is noticeably better than the 13-inch’s four-speaker system. I tossed on some of my favorite songs that go hard on the low-end bass (any Combichrist fans here?), and the 15-inch produced noticeably boomier bass lines than the 13-inch, which had as much base as a retro record player spinning vinyl.\n\nBut the speakers on the MacBook Pro 14 sound just as good, if not identical, to the 15-inch MacBook Air M3! If you’re considering the 14-inch MacBook Pro M3, the latest MacBook Airs muddle Apple’s lineup even more, leaving fewer reasons to go for the Pro model unless you want something with a fancier display or a couple more ports.\n\nThe Pro and Air models are also so close in weight and size that I’m not sure what the MacBook Air even means in an era where every single laptop company has thin and lightweight laptops. The gold standard for thickness and weight has shrunk every year since Apple released its first MacBook Air in 2008. Hell, the MacBook Pro 14 M3 is thinner than the original Air!\n\nAnd now that its wedge design is officially gone, what makes an Air an Air when it looks the same as a Pro? Although I am a Windows gal, I’ve had a few work MacBooks over the years. The one I have now is a MacBook Air M1, and at least I can put it next to a MacBook Pro, point to it, and say, “That’s a MacBook Air,” because the wedge design was and still is iconic.",

                        "newstext": "Right off the bat, the M3 MacBook Airs aren't as interesting as the M2 models.\n\nJuly 2022's M2 MacBook Air updated the design of the 13-inch laptop for the Apple Silicon era after the M1 Air's external design played it safe. And the first-ever 15-inch MacBook Air, released over a year later, was an appealing option for people who wanted a larger screen but didn't need the extra power or cost of a MacBook Pro. Together, they were a comprehensive rethink of Apple's approach to its mainstream laptops, modeled after the similarly dramatic Apple Silicon MacBook Pro redesigns.\n\nThe M3 Airs don't do any of that. They are laptop designs we've already seen, wrapped around a processor we've already seen. But they may end up being more important than the M2 Airs because of when they're being released—as the last of the Intel Macs slowly age and break and Apple winds down software support for them (if not in this year's macOS release, then almost certainly next year's).

So the M2/M3-era MacBook Air design is still striking to me, despite being the better part of two years old.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy and large, I think the newer design holds up pretty well; I don't mind the loss of the taper, even if it makes the laptop look a bit more boxy and less sleek. The full-height function row and tweaked keyboard are both good, and I don't generally have issues with trackpad palm rejection on either the 13- or 15-inch models. It's nice to have MagSafe back, though in the end, I almost always charge the Air with one of the many USB-C chargers I have strategically tucked into most rooms in the house.\n\nSpecs at a glance: Apple M3 MacBook Air (as reviewed) Screen 13.6-inch 2560×1664 IPS LCD 15.3-inch 2880×1864 OS macOS 14.4 Sonoma CPU Apple M3 (4 E-cores, 4 P-cores) RAM 16GB unified memory GPU Apple M3 (10 GPU cores) Storage 512GB soldered SSD Battery 52.6 WHr 66.5 WHr Networking Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax), Bluetooth 5.3 Ports 2x Thunderbolt/USB4, MagSafe 3, headphones Size 11.97×8.46×0.44 inches (304.1×215×113 mm) 13.40×9.35×0.45 inches (340.4×237.6×115 mm) Weight 2.7 lbs (1.24 kg) 3.3 lbs (1.51 kg) Warranty 1-year Price as reviewed $1,499 $1,699 Other perks 1080p webcam, TouchID\n\nI'm also reminded anew of just how much I like the 15-inch MacBook Air as someone who likes a big screen but doesn't use a laptop for much gaming or anything heavier than Photoshop or Lightroom (and I generally don't care that much about high-refresh-rate displays). The combination of size and weight really is close to ideal, and though the 15-inch Air is unmistakably larger and heavier than the 13-inch model, the difference isn't so large in daily use that I spend a lot of time thinking about it. The improved speaker setup is also nice to have when you're playing music or using that bigger screen to watch something.\n\nThe biggest downside of the design remains the display notch. As we and others have noted multiple times, it's not that you don't get used to it, and in typical desktop use (especially in dark mode and with a dark wallpaper), you can often forget it's there. But in the absence of FaceID or some major other functional addition, it feels like a lot of space to take up for not a lot of user-visible benefit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSure, a 1080p webcam instead of a 720p webcam is nice, but I would choose a notch-less screen with more usable space every time if given the choice. (The strips of screen to either side of the notch can only really display the macOS menu bar; go into the Control Center area of the Settings and change \"automatically hide and show the Menu Bar' to \"Never\" if you don't want those strips of screen to go totally wasted in full-screen mode).\n\nAndrew Cunningham\n\nAndrew Cunningham\n\nOne design change that Apple has highlighted for the M3 Airs is a new coating for the Midnight (read: blue-tinted black) version of the Air that is said to reduce its fingerprint-y-ness. Apple did the same thing for the M3 version of the MacBook Pro last year.\n\nThe new finish looks a shade or two lighter than the old Midnight coating and does show fingerprints a bit less. But \"less\" isn't \"none,\" and my Air was immediately, visibly fingerprint-y and skin-oily, both on the lid and in the palm rest area. It remains more noticeable than on either the Starlight finish of the 13-inch M3 Air or the space gray finish on my M1 Air. Choose your color finish accordingly.",

                        "newstext": "Amazon has quietly slashed the price on the Apple 2023 MacBook Pro Laptop in a secret sale that has the best discount of the year, so far.\n\nThe Apple 2023 MacBook Pro Laptop with the M3 Pro chip is now on sale for $1,524, instead of $1,599, for a savings of 5% off. However, there is also a $124 off clickable coupon available, which drops the laptop’s price to $1,400.\n\nThis super markdown on the 2023 MacBook Pro is the cheapest price that Amazon has offered the laptop for to date. It’s also just $1 more than the all-time low price Amazon featured during its holiday sale in December.\n\nThe big price drop on the Apple 2023 MacBook Pro comes amid speculation that Apple is releasing new MacBook models this month. At the time of writing, Apple has not publicly announced if it will.\n\nWith this 2023 MacBook Pro model, you’ll receive up to 22 hours of battery life and a 14.2-inch liquid retina XDR display. The laptop also has an 1080p FaceTime HD camera, three microphones and six-speaker sound system with spatial audio integrated.\n\nThe laptop comes with Touch ID, a MagSafe charging port, two Thunderbolt/USB ports, a DXC card slot, HDMI port and a headphone jack. It also easily integrates with your other Apple devices.\n\nFor this deal, Amazon is offering the 2023 MacBook Pro only in silver with 8 gigabytes of RAM and a storage capacity of 512 gigabytes. The space gray version of the laptop has a clickable $49 off coupon, if you prefer that color option, for the same discounted price of $1,400.\n\nThis isn’t the only MacBook Pro that Amazon has marked down. The Apple 2023 MacBook Pro Laptop with M3 Pro chip has a $150 off coupon available, which drops its price to $2,200, instead of $2,350, in the space black color. The silver model is reduced to $2,199, instead of $2,399. No coupon is available.\n\nShop for this Apple 2023 MacBook Pro laptop deal on Amazon here.\n\nYou can also check out more Apple devices on sale on Amazon, including these top offers:\n\nShop for more Apple discounts from Amazon here.\n\nOur journalism needs your support.

Google’s Deaf and hard-of-hearing employee group has 40 members. And Black women, who make up only about 2.4 percent of Google’s US workforce, leave the company at a disproportionately higher rate than women of other races, company data showed last year.\n\nSeveral former Black women employees, including AI researcher Timnit Gebru and recruiter April Christina Curley, have publicly alleged they were sidelined by an internal culture that disrespected them. Curley is leading a proposed class action lawsuit accusing Google of systemic bias but has lost initial court battles.\n\nGoogle spokesperson Emily Hawkins didn’t directly address Hall’s allegations when asked about them by WIRED. “We are committed to building an inclusive workplace and offer a range of accommodations to support the success of our employees, including sign language interpreters and captioning,” Hawkins says.\n\nFiguring out how to accommodate people like Hall could be good business for Google. One in every 10 people by 2050 will have disabling hearing loss, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nMark Takano, who represents a slice of Southern California in the US House and cochairs the Congressional Deaf Caucus, says that Google has an obligation to lead the way in demonstrating that its technology and employment practices are accommodating. “When Deaf and hard-of-hearing employees are excluded because of the inability to provide an accessible workplace, there is a great pool of talent that is left untapped—and we all lose out,” he says.\n\nUnaccommodated\n\nHall was born with profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, meaning that even with hearing aids her brain cannot process sounds well. Two separate audiologists in memos to Google said Hall needs an American Sign Language interpreter full-time. She also signs pre- and post-segregation Black ASL, which uses more two-handed signs and incorporates some African American vernacular.\n\nDuring her childhood in Louisiana, Hall's parents pushed her into speech therapy and conventional schools, where she found that some people doubted she was Deaf because she can speak. She later attended a high school for Deaf students where she became homecoming and prom queen, and realized how much more she could achieve when provided appropriate support.\n\nHall expected to find a similar environment at Google when she moved to Farmington Hills, Michigan, to become a content moderator. The company contracts ASL interpreters from a vendor called Deaf Services of Palo Alto, or DSPA. But though Hall had been assigned to enforce YouTube’s child safety rules, managers wouldn’t let her interpreters help her review that content. Google worried about exposing contractors to graphic imagery and cited confidentiality concerns, despite the fact interpreters in the US follow a code of conduct that includes confidentiality standards.\n\nGot a Tip?\n\nAre you a current or former employee at Google? We’d like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact Paresh Dave at paresh_dave@wired.com or on Signal/WhatsApp/Telegram at +1-415-565-1302.\n\nManagers transferred Hall into training to screen for videos spreading misinformation about Covid and elections. She developed a workflow that saw her default to using lipreading and automated transcriptions to review videos and turn to her interpreter if she needed further help. The transcriptions on videos used in training were high quality, so she had little trouble.\n\nHer system fell apart late in January 2021, about 20 minutes into one of her first days screening new content. The latest video in her queue was difficult to make sense of using lipreading, and the AI transcriptions in the software YouTube built for moderators were poor quality or even absent for recently uploaded content. She turned to her interpreter’s desk a few feet away—but to her surprise it was empty. “I was going to say, ‘Do you mind coming listening to this?’” she recalls.",

                "newstext": "It happens all the time. Superstars get overlooked. The passersby rush past the musical genius playing on the sidewalk. The future bestseller sits at the bottom of a slush pile. Groundbreaking work is met with skepticism or ignored. It all presents an opportunity for the intuitive and aware. Be on the look-out for the good stuff. Be the one who sees it, senses it, lives it.\n\nARIES (March 21-April 19). If you suspect that you’re at odds with yourself, take the time to adjust your thinking. Once you set your mind on the belief that you really can experience the fulfillment and joy you desire, your reality will organize around the vision.\n\nTAURUS (April 20-May 20). At first, an enterprise will seem too expensive (in money, energy or time) to get involved with, but don’t be too easily deterred. When you investigate further, you’ll find other methods and arrangements are possible.\n\nGEMINI (May 21-June 21). If you’re doing anything that is contributing to a negative dynamic, you’ll figure it out. But you may have to pull out of the situation completely to understand your part in it. Don’t strain to see it. Time will give you clarity.\n\nCANCER (June 22-July 22). Though you wear a smile and have a kind thought for all you meet, you privately keep your expectations in check. “Never rely on the glory of the morning nor the smiles of your mother-in-law.” -- Japanese proverb\n\nLEO (July 23-Aug. 22). When you were a child imagining your adult life, you had ideas about what it would be that may seem funny to you now. The vision has changed along the way, but the old imaginings still have something to teach that will bring a moment of enlightenment today.\n\nVIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22). It is said that the calm comes before the storm, but it can also go the other way. Today the excitement comes first -- not necessarily storm-like, but definitely the winds of change will blow your hair. This will be followed by a calm stretch.\n\nLIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 23). You’ll meet interesting people and stumble upon fascinating topics because you look in places others wouldn’t think to go. Your search terms are unusual, and your questions are like keys that unlock new worlds.\n\nSCORPIO (Oct. 24-Nov. 21). How do you know that your dreams are not delusions? A better question for today is: so what if they are? Preposterous ideas become regular, daily realities all the time. Progress runs on delusions.\n\nSAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21). Give yourself the time and resources you need to present yourself the way you want to. If you get it right the first time, it’s a fluke. These things are experiments. The details will make a difference.\n\nCAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19). When you think about the relationship you’d like to have with someone, the vision is as much an act of creativity as any other art form, and thereby worthy of brainstorming, daydreaming, idea-boarding and whatever else you can do to clarify the vision.\n\nAQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18). Maybe it seems like an odd thing to think about, but you’ll find yourself considering your position in a group and assessing the status and power you’re working with. Being conscious of such interplay gives you an advantage.\n\nPISCES (Feb. 19-March 20). Everything you do with others today will be a dance. Friendship, commerce, self-development, love, work... it’s all about moving in to support and be supported and then backing off to execute independent moves.\n\nTODAY’S BIRTHDAY. Seemingly disparate ideas will form an arrow pointing to your next winning endeavor. You’ll attract new people, form a dream team of new and old friends and execute a brilliant plan. More highlights: A unique and lovely and constant answer to the call of your heart, an influx of money that gives you ease and freedom and two wild excursions. Virgo and Capricorn adore you.

You certainly have the energy to do so.\n\nCancer (June 21-July 22)\n\nIn disputes about shared property or how to divide or share something with someone else, you'll come out on top because you are fervent and convincing. You believe in what you're fighting for. Romance will also be passionate (and memorable).\n\nLeo (July 23-Aug. 22)\n\nConversations with friends, partners and even members of the general public will be feisty and dynamic. Oh yes, you will stand up for what you believe. However, the reverse might be true. You might attract someone to you who is looking for a fight. Be careful.\n\nVirgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22)\n\nYou have lots of energy to make a difference today. You want to get things done and you want to do so efficiently because you want results. If you're competing with someone, this will light a fire underneath you because competition will make you identify with what you're doing, and give everything you've got.\n\nLibra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22)\n\nThis is a playful day. In particular, you have strong competitive energy which will do you well if you're in competitive sports or in any kind of team activity that needs to compete or win. Likewise, your romantic urges are strong and you won't hesitate to make the first move.\n\nScorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21)\n\nThis is the perfect day to roll up your sleeves and make improvements at home because you have the energy to do so. Be ambitious about what you want to achieve. Make things look better. You want to create some order out of chaos and busy activity.\n\nSagittarius (Nov. 22-Dec. 21)\n\nYou're unusually convincing, which is why it's a powerful day for those of you who have to persuade others, or sell, market, teach or act or make anyone listen to your words. This is because today, you'll put everything you have into what you have to say.\n\nCapricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19)\n\nToday you're willing to work hard to do something to boost your earnings or increase your wealth in some way. You're not afraid to take action. In fact, competition will spur you to greater heights. However, this same energy could tempt you to spend big. Don't be rash.\n\nAquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18)\n\nYou have strong feelings about practically everything today; but in particular, you want to make some improvements to your home, or where you live, or your family situation. You'll be able to do this because you've got focus and energy to burn!\n\nPisces (Feb. 19-March 20)\n\nThis is a strong time for you because the sun, Mercury, Saturn and Neptune are all in your sign. Nevertheless, you will likely accomplish the most today by working alone or working behind the scenes. It's all a bit hush, hush, isn't it?\n\nIf Your Birthday Is Today\n\nActor Tobias Menzies (1974) shares your birthday. You are charming, sensitive and creative. You can also be fey and otherworldly. It's important to assert yourself when need be. This is the last year of a nine-year cycle, which means it's time to let go of people and things that might be holding you back.",

Don’t forget that each new activity is just a chance to learn and develop.\n\nCancer: Today, you may face the challenge of choosing from a vast array of opportunities, which can be confusing. You may feel overwhelmed by too many options, but you must take time and weigh them all. Talking the issue over with a workmate or mentor can bring you more valuable ideas and enable you to make a better decision.

Whether it is a challenging project, an annoying colleague, or just a regular day at work, approach them all with a positive and light-hearted attitude.

For job seekers, this could be when they will need to re-strategize their job search. Don’t forget to take necessary breaks and ensure that other aspects of your life are not neglected.\n\nScorpio: Today, you may feel slightly underrated in your professional life. Let this perception not control your level of confidence. Instead, it would be best if you displayed your capacities and toughness. Think about starting a positive communication with the employers to present your contributions and aspirations. Capitalise on your strengths and what you can offer to the team. Use any available opportunities to show your abilities.\n\nSagittarius: Today is when you can have a breakthrough which can help you clarify your career goals. You may be dissatisfied at some point in the job search or the roles you have been looking at for a while. It is essential to face these matters rather than ignore them. Have open conversations with mentors or industry friends about them. The knowledge they could share may be priceless.\n\nCapricorn: True relationships are built on trust and mutual respect. Associate with people who share your worth and goals; don't be shy about cutting off fake friends. Not all people may have your interests at heart, and being vigilant about your reputation and interests is crucial. Sticking to who you are and watching for the details will give you the self-assurance and ethical standards you need to function professionally.\n\nAquarius: Today, you may even feel like losing the plot in your career, but you should know that every battle counts. A resounding victory is close at hand. Keep putting your efforts in the job hunt; your reward will soon come. Keep your positivity and demonstrate your skills and talents to the world. Stay open to other ideas and methods. The ability to adapt and innovate will be your main tools of success.\n\nPisces: Is your current job position making you feel like you're not moving forward? To err is human, but to take corrective action is brilliant. If you feel like you’re moving in the wrong direction in your career path, it's time to make some adjustments.

                        "newstext": "General Daily Insight for March 07, 2024 Anything seems possible on a day like this, even if that’s not actually the case. We’re all in the mood to get along as the Moon moves through friendly Aquarius, encouraging us to link up with like-minded friends and acquaintances in order to find fulfillment. Things get a bit of a bump, however, when the Moon squares off excitable Jupiter in stability-loving Taurus at 4:08 pm EST, making it only too easy to overestimate our abilities. Retain a sense of reality.\n\nAries March 21 – April 19 Your own desires are likely taking precedence over anything else right now. Although people may want to include you in their plans as the Moon spins through your social 11th house, a lunar square to Jupiter in your 2nd House of Material Comfort will fix your attention firmly on your own security and satisfaction. You’re not going to want to deter from your own plans for anything, so unless everyone else decides to follow your program for the day, flying solo is probably best.\n\nTaurus April 20 – May 20 Go big or go home, Taurus. The Moon in your ambitious 10th house is making a potent square to boundless Jupiter in your own sign, giving you the undeniable urge to show off your skills and stand front and center where everyone can see you. There’s nothing wrong with letting yourself shine, but Jupiter can occasionally overestimate its own abilities, so don’t thrust yourself so far forward you don’t know how to get back to where you came from. A little circumspection is key.\n\nGemini May 21 – June 20 Your daydreams can carry you further than you realize. The desire to explore is strong as the Moon travels through your exotic 9th house, and you’ll want to dive in with abandon when the Moon squares Jupiter in your fantastical 12th house, making anything and everything seem possible. Flights of fancy are perfectly fine … so long as you keep one foot planted on terra firma. This is also a very creative energy, so don’t be shy about letting the muse out to play.\n\nCancer June 21 – July 22 You are encountering an awkward juxtaposition between excitement and intensity. This strong vibration is due to a combative square between the emotive Moon in your private 8th house and excitable Jupiter in your outgoing 11th house, which could leave you unsure of how to act. People will likely come calling your name when you’d rather stay behind closed doors, so you may have to politely turn them down. Otherwise, they could think you’ve lost interest altogether. A little diplomacy will save the day.\n\nLeo July 23 – August 22 Undeniable opportunities may pull you away from other plans today. A powerful square between the Moon in your relationship sector and bountiful Jupiter in your career sector could force you to put the important people in your life on ice while you deal with certain professional matters. The work projects could be exciting and help boost you up the ladder of success, but that will likely occur at the expense of quality bonding time with others. Assure your loved ones it won’t last forever!\n\nVirgo August 23 – September 22 Your usual routine is getting thrown for a loop, albeit a pleasant one. You’re moving along at a steady pace as the Moon tours your 6th House of Efficiency, but a lunar square to impulsive Jupiter in your 9th House of Adventure is going to shake things up and give you an extra-large dose of wanderlust. If the temptation to explore is too strong to ignore, then by all means, go pursue your pleasures, but check off any important tasks before you flit off.\n\nLibra September 23 – October 22 An otherwise fun day may arrive with a touch of intensity. You’re enjoying life as the Moon dances along through your 5th House of Fun, but things take a turn for the more heated when the Moon squares off Jupiter in your 8th House of Secrets. You could feel an undeniable undercurrent moving through everything, making you think you have to read between the lines, but the harder you try to pin down the truth, the easier it slips away. Avoid overthinking and dramatizing.\n\nScorpio October 23 – November 21 Someone else has a plan for you today, even if you don’t realize it. You’d rather chill on the couch while the Moon hovers in your 4th House of Home, but someone’s going to come knocking — or demand you come to them — when the Moon squares Jupiter in your 7th House. Jupiter wants you to enjoy yourself, so this could be a wonderful surprise, but you will have to leave the comfort of your surroundings if you want to experience this bounty.\n\nSagittarius November 22 – December 21 It’s one distraction after another. You’ve got a million things to see to as the Moon bounds along through your busy 3rd house, but you’ll need to ignore the most superfluous matters when the Moon squares Jupiter in your efficient 6th house, making it wise to get down to basics. Cut out as much chatter and noise as you possibly can. It won’t be easy, but if you can manage to tune out all that static, you could achieve something quite impressive.\n\nCapricorn December 22 – January 19 There are far more exciting things to see to than work right now. Although the Moon is in your income sector, turning your attention towards productivity, a square to bountiful Jupiter in your fun-loving 5th house is going to make it difficult to focus on your usual tasks. Despite your best efforts, it might simply be too difficult to ignore the call of excitement, but you can always return to your work tomorrow without worry. Go and enjoy life — you deserve it.\n\nAquarius January 20 – February 18 There’s a buoyant energy unfurling under your own roof, Aquarius. The Moon in your sign is forming a powerful angle to Jupiter in your 4th House of Home, making this the perfect day to open your doors and let the world in. If you’re in the mood to host a group, invite the gang over for a night of games or karaoke, cheese board included! If you’re feeling more low-key, however, you could also make some fabulous aesthetic improvements to your abode.",

Aries and Taurus are advised to prioritize their own needs over social plans, while Gemini can indulge in creativity and exploration. Cancer faces tension between private desires and social obligations, Leo may have to choose between relationships and career, and Virgo must balance routine with adventure. Libra encounters intensity in relationships, Scorpio may receive unexpected invitations, Sagittarius must prioritize tasks over distractions, Capricorn should embrace fun over work, and Aquarius experiences a sense of joy and openness at home."

Another came Thursday as the Broncos released veteran safety Justin Simmons, which the team announced Thursday.\n\n\"Justin Simmons' impact as a Denver Bronco extends far beyond his exceptional play during eight seasons with our organization,\" the Broncos said in a statement. \"Justin will always be a Bronco, and we thank him for the outstanding manner in which he represented our organization on and off the field. We wish Justin, his wife Taryn, and their children Laney, Shae and Kyler the very best in the future.\"\n\nA Pro Bowler and second-team All-Pro in 2023, Simmons was set to count for $18.25 million against the cap, but will instead now carry just a $3.75 million dead cap hit, and the Broncos will save $14.5 million on their books. They will still need to do a whole bunch of maneuvering to get cap compliant after making the Wilson move, and this is likely just the start of the process.\n\nSimmons finished last season with 70 tackles, three interceptions, eight passes defensed and two forced fumbles. The Pro Bowl nod was the second of his career and the All-Pro selection was his fourth, all of them to the second team. Simmons has the versatility to line up all over the defense: According to Pro Football Focus, he has played over 1,000 career snaps in the slot (15%), over 2,000 in the box (29%) and over 3,800 as a deep free safety (54%).\n\nHe is still 30 years old and does not turn 31 until mid-November, and he should be highly sought after on the market -- especially given that due to his release, he will not count against the compensatory pick formula for any team that signs him.\n\nThe safety market, however, is now extremely crowded, with each of Eddie Jackson, Kevin Byard, Quandre Diggs, Jamal Adams, Rayshawn Jenkins, and Jordan Poyer being recently released, Xavier McKinney avoiding the transition tag, and players like Jordan Whitehead, Jordan Fuller, Kamren Curl, Tashaun Gipson, Julian Blackmon, DeShon Elliott, Geno Stone, Micah Hyde, Jayron Kearse, Mike Edwards, Brandon Jones, Jeremy Chinn, and a whole lot more reaching unrestricted free agency. It will be fascinating to see how this market develops, which players land big paydays, and which teams are able to land quality players on discounted deals after other seats are filled.",

For his impressive 2022 season, Simmons was named the inaugural winner of the Demaryius Thomas Team MVP award, as presented by the Pro Football Writers of America Denver chapter.\n\nThe Boston College product started all 105 games in which he appeared over his final seven seasons in Denver and played 118 total contests for the Broncos. He totaled 30 interceptions — which is tied for seventh in franchise history — and 64 passes defensed during his career in Denver. He also posted five forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries, 604 tackles, 19 tackles for loss and a defensive touchdown.\n\nSimmons posted a number of memorable plays in the orange and blue, including game-winning interceptions against the Raiders in 2017, the Dolphins in 2020 and the Commanders in 2021. Perhaps his most athletically impressive play came in his rookie season, as he leaped over the line of scrimmage to block an extra point and set up a game-winning score against the Saints in 2016. He also recorded a game-sealing interception in a streak-ending win against the Chiefs in 2023, which helped earn him AFC Defensive Player of the Week honors for the first time in his career.\n\nSimmons was also the Broncos' defensive iron man; from 2018-2021, he did not miss a game — and he played more than 3,200 consecutive snaps from the start of 2018 until the early weeks of the 2021 season.\n\nThe longest-tenured Bronco, though, saw his impact extend far beyond statistical milestones. In addition to being a multi-year captain, Simmons was a three-time nominee for the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year award, which is considered the NFL's most prestigious honor. He was just the second Bronco to be nominated three times for the award, and he was the first Broncos player to ever be named the nominee in back-to-back years.\n\nA four-time winner of the Broncos' Community Ambassador award, Simmons was particularly involved in youth development and social justice initiatives. He has been a strong supporter of the now annual March for Peace in Denver, and he has worked with the Justin Simmons Foundation to provide hunger relief and support for educational initiatives — among other focus areas. In his final season in Denver, Simmons participated in more than 40 community service opportunities, worked with the team's leadership program in partnership with RISE and the Broncos' Boys & Girls Club and provided grants to support the growth of girls' high school flag football.\n\nSimmons also has won the Darrent Williams Good Guy award — presented by Denver's PFWA chapter to a player for his cooperation and honesty with the media — on three occasions.",

                        "publisher": "MLive.com",
                        "newstext": "ALLEN PARK -- The NFL’s annual combine is always a valuable learning experience ahead of the draft. After covering the Detroit Lions and their run to the NFC title game, the week in Indianapolis was more educational than ever.\n\nWith free agency on the horizon, there is more to change, but let’s get into it with Ben Raven’s second mock draft of the year:\n\n1. Chicago Bears (via Carolina Panthers) -- USC QB Caleb Williams\n\nJustin Fields is a quarterback who deserves more time to hit his full potential. Fields showed more flashes with a better offensive line and weapons around him. But it’s just the combination of restarting the quarterback contract clock with a special talent like Caleb Williams. It’s too much to overcome for Fields, with his time in Chicago likely done.\n\nWilliams didn’t do much at the combine because he didn’t have to. He’s the top quarterback in this class, and Williams makes it easier to unload Fields and look to the future, again.\n\n2. Washington Commanders -- North Carolina QB Drake Maye\n\nDrake Maye combines special skill with a gunslinger mentality. And with that arm strength and aggressiveness? He’s a fit for an NFL team trying to climb out of hell like the Commanders. Maye is going to take time. But he’s going to deliver some highlight plays with those rookie mistakes and over-aggressive decisions. He remains my QB2 and the answer in Washington.\n\n3. New England Patriots -- LSU QB Jayden Daniels\n\nJayden Daniels is the safer option at QB3. And that’s coming from someone who has been on J.J. McCarthy as a first-round quarterback since the get.\n\nDaniels is an experienced starter through multiple systems. He’s built for the next level, too. And Daniels is someone who has continued to improve and get better in different ways, which is always hard to overlook. This year’s Heisman winner led an all-time explosive attack at LSU this past season, adding more than 1,000 rushing yards with 10 scores on the ground to boot.\n\n4. Arizona Cardinals -- Ohio State WR Marvin Harrison Jr.\n\nMarvin Harrison Jr. is staying in my top-five picks. That’s not going to change, whether in this mock or the next one from this beat writer. Spoiler alert. He’s a special talent who will make the Patriots think long and hard at Pick 3. Instead, Kyler Murray gets another chance to re-cement himself as a no-doubt franchise savior.\n\n5. Los Angeles Chargers -- Notre Dame OT Joe Alt\n\nJim Harbaugh is taking an offensive lineman or Georgia tight end Brock Bowers. I can’t escape that belief. Olumuyiwa Fashanu was my pick at this spot in mock draft 1.0. We’re sticking at the position but moving Joe Alt to OT1 after spending the week in Indianapolis. Alt is massive. He comes from a pro-style system and traditional power. It’s easy to think he has more room to grow, and pairing the smooth monster with Rashawn Slater is a gift for Justin Herbert.\n\n6. New York Giants -- LSU WR Malik Nabers\n\nThanks to last year’s extension, Daniel Jones will spend at least another season under center. While the Giants need to improve their offensive line and could be losing Saquon Barkley, they also need playmakers. Malik Nabers is that, and then some. He is quite the top-flight prospect as WR2 in this year’s draft. In 2023, Nabers topped 1,500 yards and caught 15 touchdowns.\n\n7. Tennessee Titans -- Penn State OT Olumuyiwa Fashanu\n\nOlumuyiwa Fashanu was my OT1 in my first mock. And while he’s dropping in the second go-round, it is a short wait. Fashanu didn’t allow a single sack over more than 700 pass-blocking snaps. He’s built. He needs some refinement. But, whew, it’s easy to see a trench star here.\n\n8. Atlanta Falcons -- Michigan QB J.J. McCarthy\n\nJust like that, this pick feels like less of a hot take. J.J. McCarthy was Pick 8 in my first mock draft, and that’s where he’s sticking two weeks later. The Falcons have Drake London, Kyle Pitts and Bijan Robinson in the fold, with a glaring hole at quarterback. Desmond Ridder, a previous draft favorite of yours truly, hasn’t been -- and doesn’t appear to be -- the answer in Atlanta.\n\nMcCarthy is a high-upside pick who brings a wealth of experience from playing on the game’s biggest stages. He always looked like someone with more to offer from the quarterback position while operating Michigan’s run-heavy offense. McCarthy feels like he has the “it factor,” and it’s tough to overlook his smooth control under center. The quarterback needs time to adjust, but it’s tough to picture a better situation for him than the one in Atlanta.\n\n9. Chicago Bears -- Georgia TE Brock Bowers\n\nBrock Bowers is a top-five talent. And don’t get lost in that position label because he’s someone who brings something different to any team’s pass-catching corps. Bowers has been considered a blue-chipper for so long now that people forget how special he’s been. Pairing him with Cole Kmet and D.J. Moore forms a versatile pass-catching trio that makes life easier for either a rookie or Justin Fields back in Chicago. The Bears would be wise to add another receiver later in the draft. But Bowers is so much more than a traditional tight end with his ability in the slot and big-play chops from all over the field. He’s a safe, high-upside pick, and I like him more than Washington wideout Rome Odunze at this spot and for this franchise.\n\n10. New York Jets -- Oregon State OT Taliese Fuaga\n\nTaliese Fuaga is one of those players who slapped me across the face at the combine (not literally), forcing me to dive deeper into his game and what he could bring. He’s touted as the draft’s top run-blocking prospect, with the classic tackle vs. guard discussion currently taking place. Wherever Fuaga plays from, he brings a refrigerator-sized frame (6-foot-6, 334 pounds) and impressive athleticism to go with his style. He allowed no sacks on 1,500-plus pass-blocking reps for the Beavers. You’re welcome, Aaron Rodgers.\n\n11. Minnesota Vikings -- Alabama EDGE Dallas Turner\n\nThere are four first-round quarterbacks in this class, and the gap between QB1/2 and QB3/4 is wide. Although the gap between QB3/4 and QB5/6 is even wider, meaning Bo Nix or Michael Penix will not be forced in this mock.\n\nDallas Turner was my pick in 1.0 for the Vikings. And the idea of what he could bring to Brian Flores’ blitz-happy defense keeps him here in 2.0. Turner scored a 9.49 Relative Athletic Score, establishing himself in my top 15.\n\n12. Denver Broncos -- Toledo CB Quinyon Mitchell\n\nIowa cornerback Cooper DeJean was here a couple of weeks ago. While DeJean would be a fine pick, I’m all in on Quinyon Mitchell as this year’s CB1. With his proven ball skills and impressive demeanor, there isn’t another option in my mind. Mitchell is the real deal.\n\nRelated: Toledo star continues to prove he belongs among ‘big dogs’ on quest to be CB1\n\n13. Las Vegas Raiders -- Illinois DL Jer’Zhan “Johnny” Newton\n\nJer’Zhan “Johnny” Newton remains my top interior defensive line prospect. His fit with edge defenders Maxx Crosby and Tyree Wilson is how you turn a team’s strength into one of the league’s top units. Newton can handle the dirty work. But he’s a pressure-creating monster on the inside, and that fits well in Las Vegas.\n\nRelated: Twitchy Illinois DL could boost pass rush but likely in trade-up range for Lions\n\n14. New Orleans Saints -- Washington WR Rome Odunze\n\nThe Saints feel like one of those teams with premium needs across the board. And with a new era at wide receiver with Michael Thomas set to hit free agency, they need some new talent on the outside for veteran Derek Carr, who appears to be getting another chance in New Orleans.\n\nRome Odunze added 15 pounds before this most recent season, then went on to make 92 catches for 1,640 yards and 13 touchdowns. At 6-foot-3 and with those skills, he’s a gift from above outside of the first 10 selections.\n\n15. Indianapolis Colts -- Alabama CB Terrion Arnold\n\nJulian Blackmon and Kenny Moore II are pending free agents, meaning the Colts need defensive back help. Terrion Arnold sticks at Pick 15 after intercepting five passes inside the vaunted SEC. He also added 6.5 tackles for loss, flashing a willingness to come up and get dirty.\n\n16. Seattle Seahawks -- Washington OL Troy Fautanu\n\nFarewell, sweet prince.\n\nTroy Fautanu, my first mock pick for Detroit, was a riser at the combine. He lands at Pick 16 this time around. Fautanu has morphed from one of my favorite fits into one of my favorite prospects in the entire draft. Fautanu might be a Day 1 starter at guard or tackle. And it’s hard to imagine a better situation than landing back with his college offensive line coach (Scott Huff) at the next level.\n\nRelated: Washington O-lineman embraces versatility and nastiness, studies Penei Swell\n\n17. Jacksonville Jaguars -- Iowa CB Cooper DeJean\n\nThe Jaguars released a pair of starters from their defensive backfield, cornerback Darious Williams and safety Rayshawn Jenkins, the week after the combine. I was already thinking cornerback for them, so that thought remains. Cooper DeJean is getting looks all over the defensive backfield, from corner to nickel and safety.\n\nDeJean’s year ended with a broken leg, but any time a prospect can avoid ligaments or tears is usually good for their stock. He was still named the Big Ten’s top defensive back and returner. DeJean allowed a 37.8 passer rating when targeted, with only one catch going for more than 15 yards with him in coverage.\n\n18. Cincinnati Bengals -- Missouri DL Darius Robinson\n\nI love to see colleague Kyle Meinke mocking Darius Robinson to the Lions. He’s a great prospect and fit, bringing Aaron Glenn’s beloved inside-outside versatility to the defensive line. I’m even higher on Robinson after last week. And here he is, bumping Texas interior defender Byron Murphy II down the order in a notable shift from my 1.0 to 2.0 projections.\n\nThe five-year player saved his best for last at Missouri. Robinson notched 14 tackles for loss and 8.5 sacks, all career-best marks by a country mile. The Michigan native had a 17% pass-rush win rate and an 8% run-stop rate as one of the top inside-outside prospects in this pool.\n\n19. Los Angeles Rams -- Georgia OL Amarius Mims\n\nAmarius Mims is a living monster among us. In Indianapolis, he measured 6-foot-7 and weighed 340 pounds. He then posted strong testing with great speed and decent explosion. Mims only has a little college tape. But throw on any of his work, and you’ll see a dominant young tackle built to handle it all. Mims might be making his way even further up the board.\n\n20. Pittsburgh Steelers -- Oregon OL Jackson Powers-Johnson\n\nThe Steelers need to ditch conventional wisdom and tradition to make an aggressive play at Justin Fields. Kenny Pickett is as much of an answer for the Steelers as Desmond Ridder is in Atlanta. Rip the band-aid off and move on under center.\n\nIn the meantime, if they can grab someone like Jackson Powers-Johnson, then all the better. He moved from guard to center, then didn’t allow a sack, finishing as the top center in the nation. Powers-Johnson was a stud at the Senior Bowl and looks ready to start off the bat.\n\n21. Miami Dolphins -- Alabama OT JC Latham\n\nAnother mock, another O-line pick for Miami. JC Latham making it this far paints a picture of how we’re all feeling about this O-line crop. He started at right tackle over the last two years, with 135 snaps at right guard in 2021. Last year, Latham allowed the only two sacks of his career. But he looks like a rising pass blocker, and that’s scary at 6-foot-6, 330-plus pounds.\n\n22. Philadelphia Eagles -- Alabama CB Kool-Aid McKinstry\n\nThe headlines surrounding Kool-Aid McKinstry at the combine aren’t the type anyone wants. The talented corner is reportedly dealing with a Jones fracture in his right foot. He’ll hit the field on his Pro Day and then get the issue fixed. The NFL Network reports that he should be ready for training camp. The talent and window of optimism in that report keep him on Day 1.\n\n23. Houston Texans (via Cleveland Browns) -- Texas DL Byron Murphy II\n\nByron Murphy II falling into the 20s is one of those things that feels likely to change in my final mock draft. He’s also an awesome fit on Houston’s defensive line, along with Will Anderson, who looks like a star on the outside. Murphy sports a near-20% pass-rush win rate with an elite 9.5% run-stop rate.\n\n24. Dallas Cowboys -- LSU WR Brian Thomas Jr.\n\nThe Cowboys could look to the offensive line, no doubt. They’ve followed that path for years, and with aging pieces in the trenches, it would be wise to hit that road again. However, Brian Thomas Jr. could be an ideal running mate for CeeDee Lamb. And with Brandin Cooks in Dallas for at least one more season, it’s a desirable spot for a rookie built like Thomas.\n\n25. Green Bay Packers -- Missouri CB Ennis Rakestraw Jr.\n\nEnnis Rakestraw Jr. had himself a rough week in Indy, with brutal on-field testing and an apparent groin injury. He also measured 5-foot-11, 183 pounds, which isn’t a deal breaker. But when paired with those speed times and ho-hum explosion testing, there are more red flags than this time two weeks ago.\n\nThat said, there is so much more than just straight-line speed. Rakestraw is a physical corner who was great in coverage while playing in the nation’s toughest conference. If teams feel OK about the play speed, then he’s still a first-round corner in a strong class of them.\n\n26. Tampa Bay Buccaneers -- Florida State EDGE Jared Verse\n\nJared Verse won 21.8% of his pass rushes, with nine sacks and 12.5 tackles for loss. The powerful edge defender was a main force behind Florida State’s elite defense in 2023.\n\n27. Arizona Cardinals (via Houston Texans) -- Clemson CB Nate Wiggins\n\nNate Wiggins’s weight of only 173 pounds is enough to send him down the order but not enough to drop him from Day 1. He’s the youngest of the first-round cornerback options. While his frame is less than ideal for the next level, his willingness and elite speed are more than enough to work with, and the Cardinals aren’t in a position to turn around that type of talent level.\n\n28. Buffalo Bills -- UCLA EDGE Laiatu Latu\n\nFrom medically retired in 2020 to one of the nation’s top trench players, Laiatu Latu had 35 tackles for loss and 23.5 sacks across two years at UCLA. If he checks the boxes in all those meetings and medical evals, then he’s a no-doubt first-rounder at a premium position.\n\n29. Detroit Lions -- Penn State EDGE Chop Robinson\n\nThere must be something about being a Detroit Lions beat writer and trying to combat the “sacks aren’t everything narrative.” Of the players left on my board, Penn State pass rusher Chop Robinson is the one who brings a special, rare trait with their game.\n\nRobinson is a lightning bolt off the defensive edges. It’s an elite first step. And not just elite, but elite, elite in that department. There are concerns about his all-around game, sure. But that’s why he’s here at Pick 29. Robinson would provide an immediate spark to the pass rush, and could be one of the steals of the draft when all is said and done. With all of my favorite first-round offensive line and the top cornerback options gone, I’m all in on the Penn State pass rusher. And he’s no consolation prize. Robinson would add a pass rusher with special traits and abilities to a defense in need of another pressure creator and demon off the edge.\n\nHe had 17.5 tackles for loss and 9.5 sacks over the last two years at Penn State. Robinson finished as PFF’s sixth-best edge rusher in 2022, then 10th in 2023. He registered a bonkers 20.9% pass-rush win rate, ranking as one of the nation’s premier pass rushers. Robinson is willing against the run, and that’s not nothing. His frame needs a little more meat on the bone to handle that work. But when you can do what he can do on the edge, that’s worth the risk.\n\nAidan Hutchinson led the Lions with 121 pressures last season. And he was a one-person show. Alim McNeill, who spent a month on injured reserve, was second on the team with 43 pressures. Hutchinson also led the way with 11.5 sacks, more than double of any of his teammates. McNeill was second in sacks, too, with five. That said, they need some help.\n\nRobinson could add a supercharged pass rusher to the rotation. And he’s not some inside-outside defensive lineman. He’s a pass rusher, and that checks a major box around these parts. I’ll try not to nerd out too much. But the Lions have loved moving pieces around, so it’s drool-inducing to imagine a pass-rushing front (for special occasions) of Hutchinson, McNeill, James Houston, and Robinson. Oh, the possibilities galore.\n\nThe man known as “Chop” is in a league of his own in terms of speed and explosion. He ran a 4.48-second 40-yard dash, the fastest and freakiest at his position. And his 1.54-second 10-yard split time is something special. Robinson added a 34.5-inch vertical and strong shuttle times on his 6-foot-2, 254-pound frame. There are size issues. But Robinson’s willingness against the run and unteachable traits on the edge lock him in as a first-round prospect.\n\nRelated: One of the combine’s biggest freaks once was a 14-pound baby named ‘Pork Chop’\n\n30. Baltimore Ravens -- Michigan CB Mike Sainristil\n\nSometimes, you need to trust and listen to your gut. Mike Sainristil is a first-round talent. The fit and longstanding history of developing players like this in Baltimore make this an easy fit to imagine for Sainristil.\n\n31. San Francisco 49ers -- Oklahoma OT Tyler Guyton\n\nTyler Guyton is the perfect prospect to pair with Trent Williams. He’s massive and looks to have shape-bending athleticism, making him a high-upside project tackle.\n\n32. Kansas City Chiefs -- Florida State WR Keon Coleman\n\nKeon Coleman remains the pick to end Round 1. His size and explosion make him a legit red-zone threat, no matter what the 40-yard dash time suggests.",

I can&#8217;t escape that belief. Olumuyiwa Fashanu was my pick at this spot in mock draft 1.0. We&#8217;re sticking at the position but moving Joe Alt to OT1 after spending the week in Indianapolis. Alt is massive. He comes from a pro-style system and traditional power. It&#8217;s easy to think he has more room to grow, and pairing the smooth monster with Rashawn Slater is a gift for Justin Herbert.</p><p id=\"InContent_Center_RMPALHBMU5CN5DECA7DKEQB7MM\" class=\"ad-observer\"></p><p id=\"inarticle-15\"></p><p class=\"article__paragraph article__paragraph--left\" id=\"GKVBK5VTRBAQTE7SVCXB23RQNI\"><b>6.

J.J. McCarthy was Pick 8 in my first mock draft, and that&#8217;s where he&#8217;s sticking two weeks later. The Falcons have Drake London, Kyle Pitts and Bijan Robinson in the fold, with a glaring hole at quarterback. Desmond Ridder, a previous draft favorite of yours truly, hasn&#8217;t been -- and doesn&#8217;t appear to be -- the answer in Atlanta.</p><p id=\"InContent_Center_5TVCEZ355JDEZGM7MZTNQUJPSQ\" class=\"ad-observer\"></p><p id=\"inarticle-21\"></p><p class=\"article__paragraph article__paragraph--left\" id=\"FZ2BKHVKRZDH3JYHNR5NVORX34\">McCarthy is a high-upside pick who brings a wealth of experience from playing on the game&#8217;s biggest stages. He always looked like someone with more to offer from the quarterback position while operating Michigan&#8217;s run-heavy offense. McCarthy feels like he has the &#8220;it factor,&#8221; and it&#8217;s tough to overlook his smooth control under center. The quarterback needs time to adjust, but it&#8217;s tough to picture a better situation for him than the one in Atlanta.</p><p id=\"InContent_Center_FZ2BKHVKRZDH3JYHNR5NVORX34\" class=\"ad-observer\"></p><p id=\"inarticle-22\"></p><p class=\"article__paragraph article__paragraph--left\" id=\"VJBQ45YDQJEYHAIXAM2JSP3TTI\"><b>9.

And don&#8217;t get lost in that position label because he&#8217;s someone who brings something different to any team&#8217;s pass-catching corps. Bowers has been considered a blue-chipper for so long now that people forget how special he&#8217;s been. Pairing him with Cole Kmet and D.J. Moore forms a versatile pass-catching trio that makes life easier for either a rookie or Justin Fields back in Chicago. The Bears would be wise to add another receiver later in the draft. But Bowers is so much more than a traditional tight end with his ability in the slot and big-play chops from all over the field. He&#8217;s a safe, high-upside pick, and I like him more than Washington wideout Rome Odunze at this spot and for this franchise.</p><p id=\"InContent_Center_NQQNCTAUGJCYNPY656ZEQZOTHI\" class=\"ad-observer\"></p><p id=\"inarticle-24\"></p><p class=\"article__paragraph article__paragraph--left\" id=\"3L5QM46HRJGTRBMK4MWYVP7GQU\"><b>10.

It&#8217;s an elite first step. And not just elite, but elite, elite in that department. There are concerns about his all-around game, sure. But that&#8217;s why he&#8217;s here at Pick 29. Robinson would provide an immediate spark to the pass rush, and could be one of the steals of the draft when all is said and done. With all of my favorite first-round offensive line and the top cornerback options gone, I&#8217;m all in on the Penn State pass rusher. And he&#8217;s no consolation prize. Robinson would add a pass rusher with special traits and abilities to a defense in need of another pressure creator and demon off the edge.</p><p id=\"InContent_Center_MEMM7WJOAFBEROEDLYDSG4KLNQ\" class=\"ad-observer\"></p><p id=\"inarticle-75\"></p><p class=\"article__paragraph article__paragraph--left\" id=\"XWYBXCYG3VHG7KQ3HC2IWCINV4\">He had 17.5 tackles for loss and 9.5 sacks over the last two years at Penn State.

Robinson is willing against the run, and that&#8217;s not nothing. His frame needs a little more meat on the bone to handle that work.

And he&#8217;s not some inside-outside defensive lineman. He&#8217;s a pass rusher, and that checks a major box around these parts. I&#8217;ll try not to nerd out too much. But the Lions have loved moving pieces around, so it&#8217;s drool-inducing to imagine a pass-rushing front (for special occasions) of Hutchinson, McNeill, James Houston, and Robinson.

Robinson added a 34.5-inch vertical and strong shuttle times on his 6-foot-2, 254-pound frame. There are size issues.

                        "newstext": "One year ago, NFL executives emerged from the scouting combine thinking the Chicago Bears were open to trading the first pick in the draft. They were right. This year, sentiment from NFL front offices holds that the Bears will use the top pick, acquired from the Carolina Panthers one year ago next week, on USC quarterback Caleb Williams.\n\nChecking in with decision-makers this time of year provides a snapshot of their expectations coming out of the combine. What they think might happen in early March evolves as the draft nears, partly because coaches become more involved in the process. But I find value in taking a snapshot to establish a baseline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI’ve put together a rough top 10 based on conversations with six executives during and after the combine. Clear themes emerged for quarterbacks, offensive linemen and receivers, with some intrigue surrounding a QB prospect whom teams haven’t assessed as fully.\n\nLast year, execs correctly projected seven of the top 10 players selected. Bijan Robinson, Jalen Carter and Darnell Wright were the three players landing in the actual top 10 without appearing in the March 2023 projection.\n\nExecs narrowly missed on offensive lineman Peter Skoronski (Tennessee picked him 11th). They missed on cornerback Christian Gonzalez, who went 17th to New England. And they whiffed on quarterback Will Levis, who was not selected until the 33rd slot — a reminder that when QBs fall, they can plummet, because only a subset of teams will consider one early in a given year.\n\nThis year, the general theme was for quarterbacks to go first, then offensive linemen, then wide receivers, with some overlap between those two final positions. Only a couple of defensive players made the projected top 10.\n\nWe are not projecting potential trades below because there are too many possibilities. Finding logical homes for the highest-ranked players based on the order as it stands today captures the general feel at the moment.\n\nFour players appeared in the top 10 on all six ballots: Caleb Williams, Jayden Daniels, Drake Maye and Joe Alt.\n\nFive players appeared on five of six ballots: Dallas Turner, Marvin Harrison Jr., Rome Odunze, Olu Fashanu and Malik Nabers.\n\nJC Latham appeared on four ballots. Jared Verse appeared on three. Brock Bowers appeared on two. Chop Robinson and Byron Murphy II each appeared on one.\n\nThe top 10 picks below have been formed from a consensus of the six ballots. Nabers and Latham were not selected in the top 10 because there was no consensus on where either would land, but they would be part of any consensus top 10 overall.\n\nMost also thought J.J. McCarthy would be selected among the top 10, probably to a team that traded up, such as the Denver Broncos. But none of the six execs penciled him in for one of the teams already picking in the top 10, at least not yet.\n\nGO DEEPER 2024 NFL Mock Draft: Trades shake up Round 1; QBs, WRs dominate early\n\n1. Chicago Bears: Caleb Williams, QB, USC\n\nVote distribution: Williams 6\n\nAll six execs had the Bears selecting Williams and trading incumbent starter Justin Fields. All endorsed Chicago heading down this path.\n\n“I would be evaluating the other quarterbacks like crazy right now and saying, ‘What if I moved down to two or three and got a historic return?'” one of the execs said. “Would I still be getting a franchise quarterback?”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe strongest concern voiced regarding Williams was his tendency to hold onto the ball longer than is ideal for a timing-based offense. In a worst-case scenario, that could lead to more third-and-long situations, robbing an offense of consistency. But the feeling among execs was that Chicago should not hesitate in making Williams the first selection.\n\nGO DEEPER Russini: What I'm hearing at the NFL combine on the Bears, Kirk Cousins and more\n\n2. Washington Commanders: Jayden Daniels, QB, LSU\n\nVote distribution: Daniels 5, Maye 1\n\nFive of six execs had Daniels heading to Washington in this slot. One of the five initially had Maye, then changed to Daniels a few days later.\n\n“I think people struggle with Maye’s mechanics,” this exec said.\n\nThe one holdout for Maye in this slot said he heard Commanders general manager Adam Peters was “really into” Maye. The fit could be appealing. Maye and incumbent Commanders starter Sam Howell were teammates at North Carolina. Howell could open the 2024 season as the starter if the Commanders wanted to give Maye time to assimilate.\n\nAnother exec left open the possibility that Michigan’s McCarthy could compete with Daniels and Maye for this slot.\n\n“If he throws well,” this exec said of McCarthy, “he is competing for the No. 2 spot. I don’t see him overtaking them, though.”\n\nThe Athletic’s Randy Mueller predicted months ago that McCarthy could rise into the top five as teams and specifically coaches learned more about him, before it was known whether McCarthy would enter the draft. Mueller, a three-time GM and one-time NFL Executive of the Year, also thinks analysts are overrating Maye based on prototypical size, and that some teams will not have Maye rated as highly.\n\nGO DEEPER Ten NFL Draft prospects to watch in bowl games: J.J. McCarthy's big opportunity\n\n“I think that whole quarterback thing between McCarthy and Maye is yet to play out,” a former GM said. “The other two I think are more set.”\n\nFor now, all six execs projected Maye being selected second or third.\n\n“Could you say McCarthy could go in the top five? Yes,” the former GM said, “because everybody had him on the back burner this fall. And then Michigan was not centered around the quarterback like Oregon or Washington was, so he was not going to put up monster numbers. But then when you start looking at the talent and the makeup, he looks pretty good to people.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. New England Patriots: Drake Maye, QB, North Carolina\n\nVote distribution: Maye 5, Daniels 1\n\nEvery exec had the Patriots selecting a quarterback in the first round. Maye was the choice more by default than because anyone thought New England was particularly high on him.\n\n“I think they would probably rather have Jayden Daniels, but I’ll put Maye in there,” one exec said.\n\nOne GM whose team already has a franchise quarterback thought McCarthy would be “a huge reach” in this spot, but he conceded New England could make a bold selection with Eliot Wolf running the draft room.\n\n“I think they go quarterback,” this GM said. “Do they take a shot at J.J.? Eliot won’t be afraid to if he believes in the player. Just look at what his dad has done.”\n\nRon Wolf famously acquired Brett Favre from the Atlanta Falcons three decades ago.\n\n“Ron Wolf’s son is going to go for the biggest, fastest, most talented athlete in most cases,” a different exec said.\n\n4. Arizona Cardinals: Dallas Turner, Edge, Alabama\n\nVote distribution: Joe Alt 2, Dallas Turner 2, Marvin Harrison Jr. 2\n\nThere was zero consensus on Arizona in this slot. I gave Turner to the Cardinals because their defense badly needs reinforcements.\n\n“Turner is squarely in the top 10 now,” one exec said, citing the Alabama product’s 4.46 in the 40-yard dash.\n\nGO DEEPER NFL combine standouts: Which QBs are rising? Who else helped their draft stock?\n\nWe could have sent Harrison or Alt to the Cardinals just the same.\n\n“I think they have to go pass rush if they stay there,” one of the execs said. “It could be Dallas Turner. Verse might be a safer pick. I would think they will be looking to move down. There is enough rush, even a Chop Robinson, to get him lower. Seven (Titans) and six (Giants) could trade up for a tackle.”\n\nTrading down from this spot makes perfect sense, perhaps regardless of how the top three picks play out.\n\n“I would expect them to trade the pick,” one of the execs said. “Look at how they moved back last year, and then the fact that this is going to be an attractive spot because it allows someone to come up from a distance to get the player they want.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis exec was picturing one of the quarterback-needy teams vaulting into this spot for McCarthy or Maye. The Cardinals have already committed to Kyler Murray as their quarterback. Moving back to, say, the 12th slot in a trade with Denver could still deliver the eighth-best non-quarterback in the draft for a team already set at the position.\n\n“That is a perfect distance maybe for Arizona to go back, load up on picks, including a first next year, and there are still players there that are going to have equal opportunity to have a significant impact,” the exec said. “They could get the No. 1 corner, the No. 2 edge guy, still a good tackle, still a good receiver.”\n\nArizona has been a popular destination for Harrison in mock drafts. While four of the six execs projected Harrison to be the first receiver selected, Nabers and Odunze also got votes, and Harrison wasn’t necessarily seen as the best by a wide margin.\n\n“I think they’ll take Marvin Harrison because I think he is the most talented, solid, all-the-way-around guy,” another exec said. “Let me put it to you this way: I see him being the best available player at that time. If you don’t look at him as better than Odunze or Nabers, then yeah, maybe you go with Alt or Dallas Turner. But they gotta keep giving their quarterback some players, too, and I think Marvin Harrison is going to check every box, and is more talented.”\n\nDallas Turner turned heads in Indianapolis with outstanding testing numbers.

Los Angeles Chargers: Joe Alt, OT, Notre Dame\n\nVote distribution: Alt 2, Fashanu 2, Turner 1, Nabers 1\n\nThe first four execs polled sent an offensive lineman to the Chargers, figuring the pick would make sense symbolically for the team’s old-school coach, Jim Harbaugh. But there was some strong pushback against this idea as well, which we’ll get to in a moment.\n\n“Joe Alt might be the safest and most complete of the tackles,” one exec said. “They have a left tackle. They could play him at right tackle. You are going to want to give the quarterback a run game, and then you are going to want to protect him for the first time in his career.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSolid thinking, but is it solid value?\n\n“That is one thing I just don’t get,” another exec said. “Taking a guy to play right tackle, I just don’t understand that. Alt is clean, and I love Alt, but with pass rushers, there is a big difference in the value of the position to me. We can find a right tackle.”\n\nThis exec penciled in Turner for the Chargers. Another leaned toward the offensive line initially but thought Nabers would make the greater impact.\n\n“To get Herbert a guy like Nabers would give them some L.A. fireworks,” he said.\n\n6. New York Giants: Marvin Harrison Jr., WR, Ohio State\n\nVote distribution: Harrison 2, Nabers 1, Odunze 1, Latham 1, Alt 1\n\nFour of the six execs had the Giants selecting a receiver, but there wasn’t strong conviction regarding which receiver would be the choice, partly because the top three wideouts could go in just about any order.\n\nAn exec who sent Harrison to the Cardinals at No. 4 settled on Odunze for the Giants.\n\n“Nabers is more speed, while Odunze is more possession, big, strong, physical,” this exec said. “They might go with Odunze just because they took the speed guy out of Tennessee (Jalin Hyatt) last year, and this would be a good complement.”\n\nThe Giants need help on their offensive line, but they’ve invested recent high draft choices in the position. The exec sending Latham to the Giants noted that the team seems to like SEC players. What about a quarterback?\n\n“If you are the Giants and J.J. McCarthy is there, I think you have to take him,” one exec said. “That doesn’t mean they will do it. They desperately need offensive line. Let’s just give them Alt. I could see them saying, ‘If Jones doesn’t work this year, we will have another top 10 pick next year and worry about it then.'”\n\n7. Tennessee Titans: Olu Fashanu, OT, Penn State\n\nVote distribution: Fashanu 2, Latham 1, Alt 1, Nabers 1, Verse 1\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFour of the six execs sent an offensive lineman to the Titans.\n\n“They have not replaced Taylor Lewan, and they need to do that,” one of the execs said. “The guy they took last year (Skoronski) was really a guard. They need a left tackle.”\n\nThe lone exec sending a defensive player to the Titans did so based on what he knows about Tennessee’s GM, Ran Carthon.\n\n“I think they go with the best pass rusher,” this exec said. “Ran would probably rely on his 49er days, probably take Verse. I have not personally studied Verse and Turner enough to have a strong opinion, but that is my gut based on what I have seen.”\n\n8. Atlanta Falcons: Jared Verse, Edge, Florida State\n\nVote distribution: Verse 2, Turner 2, Robinson 1, Latham 1\n\nThe execs generally thought the Falcons would address their quarterback situation in free agency or by trade, although one GM offered up another possibility.\n\n“They are the most likely to trade to 1 and get Caleb Williams, or trade for Fields,” this GM said.\n\nAdding young pass rush help for a veteran defense wouldn’t be as exciting. It could be the best option.\n\n“You can’t take another offensive skill player, can you?” one of the execs said. “I don’t see a quarterback necessarily because I think they are going to sign Russell Wilson. They could go corner, too, but I’ll give them a pass rusher.”\n\nGO DEEPER Is Russell Wilson a Hall of Famer? Assessing his future, legacy after Broncos flameout\n\nAnother exec cautioned against ruling out a receiver, noting that the Falcons could still use help at the position. But he thought defense was more likely.\n\n9. Chicago Bears: Rome Odunze, WR, Washington\n\nVote distribution: Odunze 3, Nabers 1, Harrison 1, Byron Murphy II 1\n\nOdunze was the highest-rated receiver available in this scenario and a straightforward pick for a team that targeted its franchise quarterback at the top of the draft. The Bears also could find a defensive player for their defensive-minded coach, Matt Eberflus, under the thinking that Williams would unlock more from their receivers, led by DJ Moore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“To pair Caleb with a top-tier receiver, both of them young, both with a lot of time, yeah, it would be really hard not to do that,” one exec said.\n\n10. New York Jets: Brock Bowers, TE, Georgia\n\nVote distribution: Bowers 2, Nabers 1, Odunze 1, Fashanu 1, Latham 1\n\nNone of the execs thought selecting a tight end in this slot would be a sound move.\n\n“When you are picking in the top 10 and you need offensive line help and you take a tight end, that is malpractice,” the exec sending Fashanu to the Jets said. “You can’t do that. That is just ridiculous.”\n\nAnother exec said the Jets needed to select a tackle in this slot, or trade back and select one. But he didn’t necessarily think the Jets would do that.\n\n“It is hard in the top 10 to not take a building-block position, but the Jets are in a unique spot because they have to win this year or they don’t have jobs,” this exec said. “You are getting weapons for Aaron Rodgers and he is going to scheme it for you. They have swung and missed on so many offensive linemen. I would think they go offensive line in free agency.”\n\nGO DEEPER NFL execs mock top 10: Jayden Daniels over Drake Maye?

Verse might be a safer pick. I would think they will be looking to move down. There is enough rush, even a Chop Robinson, to get him lower. Seven (Titans) and six (<a class=\"ath_autolink\" href=\"https://theathletic.com/nfl/team/giants/\">Giants</a>) could trade up for a tackle.&#8221;</p><p>Trading down from this spot makes perfect sense, perhaps regardless of how the top three picks play out.</p><p>&#8220;I would expect them to trade the pick,&#8221; one of the execs said. &#8220;Look at how they moved back last year, and then the fact that this is going to be an attractive spot because it allows someone to come up from a distance to get the player they want.&#8221;</p><p class=\"ad-slug\">Advertisement</p><p id=\"mid4\" class=\"ad place-ad\"></p><p>This exec was picturing one of the quarterback-needy teams vaulting into this spot for McCarthy or Maye. The Cardinals have already committed to <a class=\"ath_autolink\" href=\"https://theathletic.com/nfl/player/kyler-murray-NS1S9ZYKzjSSbF41/\">Kyler Murray</a> as their quarterback. Moving back to, say, the 12th slot in a trade with Denver could still deliver the eighth-best non-quarterback in the draft for a team already set at the position.</p><p>&#8220;That is a perfect distance maybe for Arizona to go back, load up on picks, including a first next year, and there are still players there that are going to have equal opportunity to have a significant impact,&#8221; the exec said. &#8220;They could get the No. 1 corner, the No. 2 edge guy, still a good tackle, still a good receiver.&#8221;</p><p>Arizona has been a popular destination for Harrison in mock drafts.

If you don&#8217;t look at him as better than Odunze or Nabers, then yeah, maybe you go with Alt or Dallas Turner.

But there was some strong pushback against this idea as well, which we&#8217;ll get to in a moment.</p><p>&#8220;Joe Alt might be the safest and most complete of the tackles,&#8221; one exec said. &#8220;They have a left tackle. They could play him at right tackle. You are going to want to give the quarterback a run game, and then you are going to want to protect him for the first time in his career.&#8221;</p><p class=\"ad-slug\">Advertisement</p><p id=\"mid5\" class=\"ad place-ad\"></p><p>Solid thinking, but is it solid value?</p><p>&#8220;That is one thing I just don&#8217;t get,&#8221; another exec said. &#8220;Taking a guy to play right tackle, I just don&#8217;t understand that. Alt is clean, and I love Alt, but with pass rushers, there is a big difference in the value of the position to me. We can find a right tackle.&#8221;</p><p>This exec penciled in Turner for the Chargers. Another leaned toward the offensive line initially but thought Nabers would make the greater impact.</p><p>&#8220;To get Herbert a guy like Nabers would give them some L.A. fireworks,&#8221; he said.</p><h2>6. <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/nfl/team/giants/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">New York Giants</a>: Marvin Harrison Jr., WR, Ohio State</h2><p><strong>Vote distribution:</strong> Harrison 2, Nabers 1, Odunze 1, Latham 1, Alt 1</p><p>Four of the six execs had the Giants selecting a receiver, but there wasn&#8217;t strong conviction regarding which receiver would be the choice, partly because the top three wideouts could go in just about any order.</p><p>An exec who sent Harrison to the Cardinals at No. 4 settled on Odunze for the Giants.</p><p>&#8220;Nabers is more speed, while Odunze is more possession, big, strong, physical,&#8221; this exec said. &#8220;They might go with Odunze just because they took the speed guy out of Tennessee (<a class=\"ath_autolink\" href=\"https://theathletic.com/nfl/player/jalin-hyatt-X8ZBCItogSCpxtOB/\">Jalin Hyatt</a>) last year, and this would be a good complement.&#8221;</p><p>The Giants need help on their offensive line, but they&#8217;ve invested recent high draft choices in the position. The exec sending Latham to the Giants noted that the team seems to like SEC players. What about a quarterback?</p><p>&#8220;If you are the Giants and J.J. McCarthy is there, I think you have to take him,&#8221; one exec said. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t mean they will do it. They desperately need offensive line. Let&#8217;s just give them Alt. I could see them saying, &#8216;If Jones doesn&#8217;t work this year, we will have another top 10 pick next year and worry about it then.'&#8221;</p><h2>7. <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/nfl/team/titans/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tennessee Titans</a>: Olu Fashanu, OT, Penn State</h2><p><strong>Vote distribution:</strong> Fashanu 2, Latham 1, Alt 1, Nabers 1, Verse 1</p><p class=\"ad-slug\">Advertisement</p><p id=\"mid6\" class=\"ad place-ad\"></p><p>Four of the six execs sent an offensive lineman to the Titans.</p><p>&#8220;They have not replaced <a class=\"ath_autolink\" href=\"https://theathletic.com/nfl/player/taylor-lewan-bT4i6VCV1a1nrgrX/\">Taylor Lewan</a>, and they need to do that,&#8221; one of the execs said. &#8220;The guy they took last year (Skoronski) was really a guard.

                "newstext": "The woolly mammoth could roam the Earth once again.\n\nThat’s the goal of Colossal Biosciences as the biotech company announced a major breakthrough Wednesday in its mission to revive the 6-ton, 16-foot animal back from extinction.\n\nThe Dallas-based company said it has created a set of stem cells from an Asian elephant in hopes of bringing back a creature that would be eerily similar to the woolly mammoth, according to reports.\n\n“This is probably the most significant step in the early stages of this project,” said geneticist and company co-founder George Church, a Harvard University professor, according to NPR.\n\nThe wooly mammoth could once again roam the earth. Shutterstock / Pavel Masychev\n\nThe woolly mammoth went the way of the dodo bird about 4,000 years ago, and while the company wouldn’t bring back the same exact species, it would create an animal that has similar traits like a heavy fur coat and plenty of fat to withstand freezing temperatures.\n\n“It will walk like a Woolly Mammoth, look like one, sound like one, but most importantly it will be able to inhabit the same ecosystem previously abandoned by the Mammoth’s extinction,” the company said.\n\nThe company’s goal, however lofty, is to eventually genetically tinker a stem cell’s nucleus with genes from a mammoth, then merge that with an elephant egg, the Washington Post reported. Then the embryo would be placed in an elephant surrogate who would hopefully give birth.\n\nBut not everyone is on board with Colossal’s goal.\n\nA University of Sheffield paleontologist in England, Tori Herridge, warned any living elephant that gives birth to a new mammoth will face at least some level of suffering.\n\n“How many dead elephants are we willing to have to get one woolly one,” she told the Washington Post.\n\nCo-founder George Church says the step was a major breakthrough.\n\nAnother scientist bluntly called it “irresponsible.”\n\n“What are you going to get out of this?” Karl Flessa, a geosciences professor at the University of Arizona, told NPR.\n\n“First of all, I think you’re going to get a bit of a freak show in a zoo somewhere.

                        "newstext": "A company aiming to bring extinct animals back from the dead said it has taken an elephant-sized step toward genetically resurrecting the woolly mammoth, a wild if contentious goal to repopulate the Arctic tundra with a missing titan. Sign up for the Climate Coach newsletter and get advice for life on our changing planet, in your inbox every Tuesday. ArrowRight Colossal Biosciences, a biotechnology company based in Dallas, announced Wednesday it has produced a line of Asian elephant stem cells that can be coaxed to transform into other types of cells needed to reconstruct the extinct giant — or at a least a mammoth-like elephant designed to thrive in the cold.\n\n“It’s probably the most significant thing so far in the project,” said George Church, a Harvard geneticist and Colossal co-founder. “There are many steps in the future.”\n\nFor proponents, bringing back vanished animals is a chance to correct humanity’s role in the ongoing extinction crisis. Breakthroughs in their field, they say, may yield benefits for animals still with us, including endangered elephants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet the technical challenges of birthing into the world a living, breathing mammoth remain, well, colossal. And the project raises hairy ethical questions: Who decides what comes back? Where will the reborn species go? Could the money be better spent elsewhere? And how hard will “de-extinction,” as the revival efforts are known, be on the animals themselves?\n\n“The lack of knowledge is the thing that worries me about the welfare of animals,” said Heather Browning, a philosopher at the University of Southampton in England and a former zookeeper.\n\nCan we really bring back the mammoth?\n\nDuring the last ice age, the woolly mammoth owned the top of the world, plodding across Eurasia and North America and as far south as the modern-day Midwest.\n\nAs the creatures died out 4,000 years ago, some carcasses froze over in icy tundra that preserved not only their bones but also their flesh and fur, giving paleontologists the chance to collect DNA fragments. Some mammoth meat was so well kept that at least one adventurous researcher has eaten it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy 2015, scientists sequenced its genetic blueprint well enough to offer a potential manual for remaking a mammoth. But to test what exactly each of these genes do — which give the beast their curved tusks, fatty build and, of course, thick fur — Church wants elephant stem cells in which he could engineer mammoth DNA and grow tissue samples.\n\nScientists have produced such stem cells in the lab for other animals, including humans, mice, pigs and even rhinos. But for years, getting the right elephant stem cells to test all those cold-climate characteristics proved elusive, in part because elephant cells’ ability to avoid cancer made reprogramming them difficult.\n\nColossal said they have produced the stem cells they need by suppressing the anti-cancer genes and bathing the cells in the right chemical cocktail. Colossal published a preprint Wednesday that is not yet peer-reviewed. The company said it is working to place the study in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It hasn’t been straightforward,” said Eriona Hysolli, the company’s head of biological sciences. “It hasn’t been immediately obvious. There were a lot of innovations along the way.”\n\nJeanne Loring, a researcher at the Scripps Research in California who helped develop potent stem cells for the northern white rhinoceros, said the work showed the elephant researchers’ persistence. “This is an incredibly steep hill they have ahead,” she added. “The challenges get bigger and bigger with the size of the animal.”\n\nEventually, the company wants to genetically edit a nucleus of a stem cell with mammoth genes and fuse it into an elephant egg. From there, if everything goes according to plan — still a big if — they will implant the embryo in an elephant surrogate and wait for it to give birth.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nEven if we can, should we?\n\nMatthew Cobb, a zoologist at the University of Manchester in England, said all those “ifs” may be insurmountable. There is no guarantee that the modified chromosomes can be introduced to an elephant cell, or if that an embryo will take hold in an elephant womb.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd perhaps more profoundly, there is the question of how a mammoth, if born, will learn to behave like a mammoth. “Most of the mammals and birds that are being talked about have complex social and cultural interactions that have been lost,” Cobb said. “They are not simply their genes.”\n\nModern elephants, for instance, are highly social beings, passing down knowledge about the location of watering holes and other survival skills from one generation to the next. Their ancient cousins may be similar. “They’ve got no elders to raise them, to teach them,” Browning said. “They’re got no way of learning how to be mammoths.”\n\nAnd any living surrogate elephant meant to gestate and give birth to a new mammoth will go through some degree of hardship. “How many dead elephants are we willing to have to get one woolly one?” said Tori Herridge, a paleobiologist specializing in ancient elephants at the University of Sheffield in England.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColossal said its long-term goal is to use artificial wombs to gestate the animals, itself a tall technological task. The company notes that its research into elephant cells can help with current conversation efforts, such as potential treatments for a form of herpes that kills young elephants. Indeed, the company hopes to make money by licensing or selling some of the technologies it creates along the way.\n\n“It’s not so much bringing back the mammoth, it’s saving an endangered species,” Church said. “It’s working out technology that’s useful for conservation and climate change.”\n\nBut Cobb said the biggest threats facing elephants are hunting, habitat destruction and other conflicts with humans. “How will a greater understanding of cell biology help?”\n\nWhat if they go extinct again?\n\nOne of Colossal’s overarching arguments for bringing back the mammoth is climate change. Scientists at the company say future Arctic herds can stomp down permafrost and prevent more of it from thawing and releasing atmosphere-warming carbon into the air.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“They’re a lot of reasons to restore that environment to what it was,” Church said. “This is the keystone species that’s missing for that.”\n\nThen there is this philosophical question: Is a bioengineered mammoth truly a mammoth? Or is it a furrier elephant that can tolerate the cold?\n\n“It’s a completely new organism that’s being created,” Herridge said. She added that it is still an open question as to what killed off the woolly mammoth: Was it humans overhunting them, or the natural end of the last ice age? If the answer is the latter, then the Arctic may be unsuitable for the resurrected creature, whatever you want to call it.\n\n“I would love to see a mammoth alive,” she said. “I would absolutely love to have a time machine where I could go back to the ice age, and I could see a herd of mammoths being mammoths in the landscape in which they evolved.”",

                        "publisher": "Livescience.com",
                        "newstext": "Scientists have made a stem cell breakthrough in elephants, which could mean researchers are one step closer to bringing back long-extinct woolly mammoths, the de-extinction company Colossal Biosciences has announced.\n\nIn a statement shared with Live Science, Colossal's Woolly Mammoth team says it has successfully derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from Asian elephants (Elephas maximus). iPSCs are cells that have been reprogrammed so they can give rise to any cell type in the body, meaning researchers will now be able to investigate the adaptations that differentiate woolly mammoths (Mammuthus primigenius) from their closest living relatives and test gene edits without having to take tissue from living animals.\n\n\"These cells definitely are a great benefit to our de-extinction work,\" Eriona Hysolli , the head of biological sciences and mammoth lead at Colossal Biosciences, told Live Science. What's crucial about them, Hysolli said, is that they can reveal the cellular and genetic processes behind features that helped woolly mammoths thrive in the Arctic . These features include shaggy hair, curved tusks, fat deposits and a dome-shaped cranium.\n\niPSCs also open a path to creating elephant sperm and egg cells, which are essential for mammoth de-extinction, in the lab. With fewer than 52,000 Asian elephants left in the wild, according to WWF , harvesting cells from these animals would prove difficult and undesirable.\n\nPreviously, deriving elephant iPSCs proved challenging because these animals have a complex gene pathway not found in other species. The researchers overcame this by suppressing core genes called TP53 that regulate cell growth and prevent cells from duplicating indefinitely, Hysolli said.\n\nRelated: 'That's a huge amount of movement for a single mammoth': Woolly female's steps retraced based on chemistry of 14,000-year-old tusk\n\n\"One of the things that we had to overcome for elephant cells is that they do have this expansive TP53 pathway,\" Hysolli said. \"We had to suppress this pathway via two means in order to get these iPSCs, so we had to go through a multistep process in order to achieve them.\"\n\nThe breakthrough may also shed light on early development in elephants, which is currently considered the biggest hurdle to woolly mammoth de-extinction. If researchers succeed in creating a woolly mammoth embryo by fusing ancient mammoth DNA with elephant cells , they will need to implant this embryo into an elephant surrogate to complete a 22-month gestation period. \"Elephant gestation is so long and complex, so really understanding the developmental biology aspect of elephant biology is so important,\" Hysolli said.\n\nAsian elephants (Elephas maximus) are the closest living relatives of extinct woolly mammoths. (Image credit: Raghupathi K.V. / 500px via Getty Images)\n\nEngineering a woolly mammoth embryo no longer poses a huge challenge, Hysolli said, but birthing a healthy calf will take more time and work. The team is still researching alternative methods to generate elephant iPSCs and maturing the ones they have newly developed. The iPSCs breakthrough, which will be published on the preprint database bioRxiv, has yet to be peer-reviewed.\n\n\"There is more validation to be done, so until you do the experiment you can never be sure, but we think that the pluripotency potential [to differentiate into any cell type] is fully there,\" Hysolli said.\n\nThis is an important breakthrough and an essential step to create a woolly mammoth-like elephant, said Vincent Lynch , a developmental biologist and associate professor at the University at Buffalo in New York who was not involved in Colossal's work. \"The goal, I think, is to turn these iPSCs into sperm and eggs, which would allow for in vitro fertilization and, eventually, surrogacy,\" Lynch told Live Science in an email. \"Those methods are pretty challenging and haven’t been developed yet, but it is only a matter of time.\"\n\nReprogramming elephant cells into iPSCs has applications beyond woolly mammoth de-extinction, according to the statement. The technology could provide a boost to elephant conservation, for example, by enabling researchers to produce and fertilize reproductive cells artificially.\n\n\"We can derive gametes, so oogonia and spermatogonia-like cells, from these pluripotent stem cells,\" Hysolli said. \"And that's crucial over the longer term, because they can really hold the key to saving species.\"",

With fewer than 52,000 Asian elephants left in the wild, according to <a href=\"https://www.wwf.org.uk/learn/wildlife/asian-elephants\" target=\"_blank\">WWF</a>, harvesting cells from these animals would prove difficult and undesirable.</p><p>Previously, deriving elephant iPSCs proved challenging because these animals have a complex gene pathway not found in other species. The researchers overcame this by suppressing core genes called TP53 that regulate cell growth and prevent cells from duplicating indefinitely, Hysolli said.</p><p id=\"ad-unit-2\" class=\"ad-unit\"></p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/animals/mammoths/thats-a-huge-amount-of-movement-for-a-single-mammoth-woolly-females-steps-retraced-based-on-chemistry-of-14000-year-old-tusk\"><strong>'That's a huge amount of movement for a single mammoth': Woolly female's steps retraced based on chemistry of 14,000-year-old tusk</strong></a></p><p>\"One of the things that we had to overcome for elephant cells is that they do have this expansive TP53 pathway,\" Hysolli said. \"We had to suppress this pathway via two means in order to get these iPSCs, so we had to go through a multistep process in order to achieve them.\"</p><p>The breakthrough may also shed light on early development in elephants, which is currently considered the biggest hurdle to woolly mammoth de-extinction. If researchers succeed in creating a woolly mammoth embryo by <a href=\"https://www.livescience.com/50275-bringing-back-woolly-mammoth-dna.html\">fusing ancient mammoth DNA with elephant cells</a>, they will need to implant this embryo into an elephant surrogate to complete a 22-month gestation period. \"Elephant gestation is so long and complex, so really understanding the developmental biology aspect of elephant biology is so important,\" Hysolli said.&#160;</p><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\"><img src=\"https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/livescience/media/img/missing-image.svg\" alt=\"Asian elephants walking through tall grass in India.\" class=\"expandable lazy-image-van\"></p><p class=\"caption-text\">Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) are the closest living relatives of extinct woolly mammoths. </p><p class=\"credit\">(Image credit: Raghupathi K.V. / 500px via Getty Images)</p><p>Engineering a woolly mammoth embryo no longer poses a huge challenge, Hysolli said, but birthing a healthy calf will take more time and work. The team is still researching alternative methods to generate elephant iPSCs and maturing the ones they have newly developed. The iPSCs breakthrough, which will be published on the preprint database bioRxiv, has yet to be peer-reviewed.</p><p>\"There is more validation to be done, so until you do the experiment you can never be sure, but we think that the pluripotency potential [to differentiate into any cell type] is fully there,\" Hysolli said.</p><p>This is an important breakthrough and an essential step to create a woolly mammoth-like elephant, said <a href=\"https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/biological-sciences/faculty/faculty-directory/vincent-lynch.html\" target=\"_blank\">Vincent Lynch</a>, a developmental biologist and associate professor at the University at Buffalo in New York who was not involved in Colossal's work. \"The goal, I think, is to turn these iPSCs into sperm and eggs, which would allow for in vitro fertilization and, eventually, surrogacy,\" Lynch told Live Science in an email. \"Those methods are pretty challenging and haven&#8217;t been developed yet, but it is only a matter of time.\"</p><p>Reprogramming elephant cells into iPSCs has applications beyond woolly mammoth de-extinction, according to the statement. The technology could provide a boost to elephant conservation, for example, by enabling researchers to produce and fertilize reproductive cells artificially.</p><p>\"We can derive gametes, so oogonia and spermatogonia-like cells, from these pluripotent stem cells,\" Hysolli said. \"And that's crucial over the longer term, because they can really hold the key to saving species.\"</p>\n</div>",

                        "publisher": "The Atlantic",
                        "newstext": "On June 3, 2021, a roughly 60-year-old man in the riverside city of Magdeburg, Germany, received his first COVID vaccine. He opted for Johnson & Johnson’s shot, popular at that point because unlike Pfizer’s and Moderna’s vaccines, it was one-and-done. But that, evidently, was not what he had in mind. The following month, he got the AstraZeneca vaccine. The month after that, he doubled up on AstraZeneca and added a Pfizer for good measure. Things only accelerated from there: In January 2022, he received at least 49 COVID shots.\n\nA few months later, employees at a local vaccination center thought to themselves, Huh, wasn’t that guy in here yesterday? and alerted the police. By that point, the German Press Agency reported, the man had been vaccinated as many as 90 times. And still he was not done. As of November, he said he’d received 217 COVID shots—217!\n\nThat’s according to a new paper published in The Lancet. After German researchers learned of the man from newspaper articles, they managed to contact him via the public prosecutor investigating the case. He was “very interested” in participating in a study Kilian Schober, an immunologist at Uniklinikum Erlangen and a co-author on the paper said in a statement. They pieced together his vaccination timeline through interviews and medical records, and collected blood and saliva samples to examine the immunological effects of “hypervaccination.”\n\nThe man’s identity hasn’t been revealed, and in the paper he’s referred to only as “HIM” (seemingly an acronym, though what it stands for is not specified). He is hardly the world’s only hypervaccinated person. A retired postman in India had reportedly received 12 shots by January 2022 and told The New York Times, “I still want more.” A New Zealand man, meanwhile, allegedly racked up 10 in a single day. But pause for a moment and consider the sheer logistics of HIM’s feat. In all, he received his 217 vaccinations over the course of just under two and a half years, which comes out to an average of seven and a half shots a month, although the distribution was far from even. For several weeks in early 2022, he received two shots nearly every day. He seems to have had a strong preference for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, but he also got at least one shot of AstraZeneca and Sanofi-GSK and, of course, Johnson & Johnson.\n\nWhy? you might wonder. The paper itself elides this question, saying only that he did so “deliberately and for private reasons.” Perhaps the most obvious explanation would be extreme, probably pathological COVID anxiety. News reports from April 2022 offer another possible explanation: that he did so to sell the vaccination cards. But German prosecutors did not bring charges once HIM’s scheme was uncovered, and he continued getting unnecessary shots.\n\nGetting 217 COVID shots is very much not the public-health guidance in Germany or anywhere else. Yet the strategy seemingly panned out: HIM has never contracted COVID, researchers concluded based on antigen tests, PCR tests, and bloodwork. “If you ask immunologists, we might have predicted that it would be not beneficial to do this,” Cindy Leifer, an immunologist at Cornell University who wasn’t involved with the Lancet study, told me. They might have expected the constant action to exhaust the immune system, leaving it vulnerable to actual viral threats. But such worries came to nothing.\n\nStill, immunologists cautioned against inferring any strong causal connection. He avoided the virus; he got vaccinated 217 times. He did not necessarily avoid the virus because he got vaccinated 217 times. In fact, the authors wrote, although hypervaccination seems to have increased the quantity of antibodies and T cells that HIM’s body produced to fend off the virus—even after 216 shots, the 217th still produced a modest increase—it had no real effect on the quality of the immune response. “He would have been just as well protected if he had gotten a normal number of three to four vaccinations,” Schober told me.\n\nNor did hypervaccination lead to any adverse effects. By shot 217, one might have expected to see some of the rare side effects associated with the vaccines, such as myocarditis, pericarditis, or Guillain-Barré Syndrome, but as far as researchers could tell, HIM was completely fine. Remarkably, he didn’t even report feeling minor side effects from any of his 217 shots.

                        "article_html": "<div><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">On June 3, 2021, a roughly 60-year-old man in the riverside city of Magdeburg, Germany, received his first COVID vaccine. He opted for Johnson &amp; Johnson&#8217;s shot, popular at that point because unlike Pfizer&#8217;s and Moderna&#8217;s vaccines, it was one-and-done. But that, evidently, was not what he had in mind. The following month, he got the AstraZeneca vaccine. The month after that, he doubled up on AstraZeneca and added a Pfizer for good measure. Things only accelerated from there: In January 2022, he received at least 49 COVID shots.</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\"></p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">A few months later, employees at a local vaccination center thought to themselves, Huh, wasn&#8217;t that guy in here yesterday? and alerted the police. By that point, the German Press Agency reported, the man had been vaccinated as many as <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/covid-health-germany-europe-document-forgery-120b2c4db8aa71ffeadf766a9829910b\">90 times</a>. And still he was not done. As of November, he said he&#8217;d received 217 COVID shots&#8212;217!</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\"></p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">That&#8217;s according to a <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(24)00134-8/fulltext#sec1\">new </a><a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(24)00134-8/fulltext#sec1\">paper</a> published in The Lancet. After German researchers learned of the man from newspaper articles, they managed to contact him via the public prosecutor investigating the case. He was &#8220;very interested&#8221; in participating in a study Kilian Schober, an immunologist at <a href=\"https://www.mikrobiologie.uk-erlangen.de/forschung/forschergruppen-arbeitsgruppen/ag-dr-k-schober/\">Uniklinikum Erlangen</a> and a co-author on the paper <a href=\"https://www.fau.eu/2024/03/05/news/research/researchers-investigate-immune-response-of-a-man-who-received-217-covid-vaccinations/\">said in a statement</a>. They pieced together his vaccination timeline through interviews and medical records, and collected blood and saliva samples to examine the immunological effects of &#8220;hypervaccination.&#8221;</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\"></p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">The man&#8217;s identity hasn&#8217;t been revealed, and in the paper he&#8217;s referred to only as &#8220;HIM&#8221; (seemingly an acronym, though what it stands for is not specified). He is hardly the world&#8217;s only hypervaccinated person. A retired postman in India had reportedly received 12 shots by January 2022 and told The New York Times, &#8220;I still want more.&#8221; A New Zealand man, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/13/new-zealand-authorities-investigate-claims-man-received-10-covid-vaccinations-in-one-day\">allegedly</a> racked up 10 in a single day. But pause for a moment and consider the sheer logistics of HIM&#8217;s feat. In all, he received his 217 vaccinations over the course of just under two and a half years, which comes out to an average of seven and a half shots a month, although the distribution was far from even. For several weeks in early 2022, he received two shots nearly every day. He seems to have had a strong preference for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, but he also got at least one shot of AstraZeneca and Sanofi-GSK and, of course, Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\"></p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">Why? you might wonder. The paper itself elides this question, saying only that he did so &#8220;deliberately and for private reasons.&#8221; Perhaps the most obvious explanation would be extreme, probably pathological COVID anxiety. News reports from April 2022 offer another possible explanation: that he did so to sell the vaccination cards. But German prosecutors did not bring charges once HIM&#8217;s scheme was uncovered, and he continued getting unnecessary shots.</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\"></p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">Getting 217 COVID shots is very much not the public-health guidance in Germany or anywhere else. Yet the strategy seemingly panned out: HIM has never contracted COVID, researchers concluded based on antigen tests, PCR tests, and bloodwork. &#8220;If you ask immunologists, we might have predicted that it would be not beneficial to do this,&#8221; Cindy Leifer, an immunologist at Cornell University who wasn&#8217;t involved with the Lancet study, told me. They might have expected the constant action to exhaust the immune system, leaving it vulnerable to actual viral threats. But such worries came to nothing.</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\"></p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">Still, immunologists cautioned against inferring any strong causal connection. He avoided the virus; he got vaccinated 217 times. He did not necessarily avoid the virus because he got vaccinated 217 times. In fact, the authors wrote, although hypervaccination seems to have increased the quantity of antibodies and T cells that HIM&#8217;s body produced to fend off the virus&#8212;even after 216 shots, the 217th still produced a modest increase&#8212;it had no real effect on the quality of the immune response. &#8220;He would have been just as well protected if he had gotten a normal number of three to four vaccinations,&#8221; Schober told me.</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\"></p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">Nor did hypervaccination lead to any adverse effects. By shot 217, one might have expected to see some of the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html\">rare side effects</a> associated with the vaccines, such as myocarditis, pericarditis, or Guillain-Barr&#233; Syndrome, but as far as researchers could tell, HIM was completely fine. Remarkably, he didn&#8217;t even report feeling minor side effects from any of his 217 shots. On some level, this makes total sense: As Schober reasonably pointed out, HIM probably would not have gotten all those shots if each one had knocked him out for a day. Fair, but still: 217 shots and no side effects? How?</p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\"></p><p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\">If nothing else, HIM is one hell of an advertisement for the vaccines. Worried about side effects from your third booster? Well, this guy&#8217;s gotten more than 200, and he&#8217;s a-okay.

                "newstext": "Plastics are now everywhere, with tiny fragments found in several major organs of the human body, including the placenta.\n\nGiven how easily the microscopic particles infiltrate our tissues, it's vital that we learn exactly what kinds of risks they could pose to our health.\n\nResearchers have been busy studying the effects of microplastics in mini-replicas of organs, and in mice, to get a sense of how they might impact the human body. However, the concentrations of microplastics used in those studies might not reflect people's real-world exposure, and few studies have been done in humans.\n\nNow, a small study in Italy has found shards of microplastics in fatty deposits surgically removed from patients who had an operation to open up their clogged arteries – and reported their health outcomes nearly 3 years later.\n\nRemoving fatty plaques from narrowed arteries in a procedure called a carotid endarterectomy reduces the risk of future strokes.\n\nThe team behind this new study, led by Raffaele Marfella, a medical researcher at the University of Campania in Naples, wondered how the risk of stroke – as well as heart attacks and death – compared between patients who had microplastics in their plaques and those who did not.\n\nFollowing 257 patients for 34 months, the researchers found nearly 60 percent of them had measurable amounts of polyethylene in plaques pulled from their fat-thickened arteries, and 12 percent also had polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in extracted fat deposits.\n\nPVC comes in both rigid and flexible forms, and is used to make water pipes, plastic bottles, flooring, and packaging. Polyethylene is the most commonly produced plastic, used for plastic bags, films, and bottles, too.\n\nWith microplastics previously found coursing through people's bloodstream, the researchers were reasonably concerned about heart health. Lab-based studies suggest microplastics can trigger inflammation and oxidative stress in heart cells, and impair heart function, alter heart rate, and cause scarring of the heart in animals such as mice.\n\n\"Observational data from occupational-exposure studies [also] suggest an increased risk of cardiovascular disease among persons who are exposed to plastics-related pollution, including polyvinyl chloride, than that seen in the general population,\" Marfella and colleagues write.\n\nIn the study, patients with microplastics in their excised plaques were twice as likely to have experienced a stroke, non-fatal heart attack or died from any cause after 34 months than people who had no detectable microplastics in the plaques that surgeons had removed.\n\nThe amount of microplastics, and even smaller particles called nanoplastics, was measured using a technique called pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, and their presence confirmed using another method, stable isotopes analysis, which can distinguish between the carbon of human tissues and that of plastics made from petrochemicals.\n\nMicroplastics were also visible under powerful microscopes: The researchers observed plastic fragments with jagged edges inside immune cells called macrophages, and within the fatty plaques. Examining the tissue samples, the team also found higher levels of inflammatory markers in patients with microplastics in their plaques.\n\nBear in mind, however, that an observational study like this can't definitively conclude that microplastics are causing the downstream heart effects; only that there is an association. The study did not consider other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as smoking, physical inactivity, and air pollution.\n\n\"Although we do not know what other exposures may have contributed to the adverse outcomes among patients in this study, the finding of microplastics and nanoplastics in plaque tissue is itself a breakthrough discovery that raises a series of urgent questions,\" such as how to reduce exposure, writes pediatrician, public health physician and epidemiologist Philip J. Landrigan, of Boston College, in an accompanying editorial.\n\nPlastic production has exploded in the past two decades, only a fraction of which has been recycled, and yet rates of cardiovascular disease have been falling in some parts of the world, so more research is needed to understand the link between the two.\n\nThe study has been published in the New England Journal of Medicine.",

                        "newstext": "Plastics are just about everywhere — food packaging, tyres, clothes, water pipes. And they shed microscopic particles that end up in the environment and can be ingested or inhaled by people.\n\nNow the first data of their kind show a link between these microplastics and human health. A study of more than 200 people undergoing surgery found that nearly 60% had microplastics or even smaller nanoplastics in a main artery1. Those who did were 4.5 times more likely to experience a heart attack, a stroke or death in the approximately 34 months after the surgery than were those whose arteries were plastic-free.\n\n“This is a landmark trial,” says Robert Brook, a physician-scientist at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, who studies the environmental effects on cardiovascular health and was not involved with the study. “This will be the launching pad for further studies across the world to corroborate, extend and delve into the degree of the risk that micro- and nanoplastics pose.”\n\nBut Brook, other researchers and the authors themselves caution that this study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine on 6 March, does not show that the tiny pieces caused poor health. Other factors that the researchers did not study, such as socio-economic status, could be driving ill health rather than the plastics themselves, they say.\n\nPlastic planet\n\nScientists have found microplastics just about everywhere they’ve looked: in oceans; in shellfish; in breast milk; in drinking water; wafting in the air; and falling with rain.\n\nSuch contaminants are not only ubiquitous but also long-lasting, often requiring centuries to break down. As a result, cells responsible for removing waste products can’t readily degrade them, so microplastics accumulate in organisms.\n\nMicroplastics are everywhere — but are they harmful?\n\nIn humans, they have been found in the blood and in organs such as the lungs and placenta. However, just because they accumulate doesn’t mean they cause harm. Scientists have been worried about the health effects of microplastics for around 20 years, but what those effects are has proved difficult to evaluate rigorously, says Philip Landrigan, a paediatrician and epidemiologist at Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts.\n\nGiuseppe Paolisso, an internal-medicine physician at the University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli in Caserta, Italy, and his colleagues knew that microplastics are attracted to fat molecules, so they were curious about whether the particles would build up in fatty deposits called plaques that can form on the lining of blood vessels. The team tracked 257 people undergoing a surgical procedure that reduces stroke risk by removing plaque from an artery in the neck.\n\nBlood record\n\nThe researchers put the excised plaques under an electron microscope. They saw jagged blobs — evidence of microplastics — intermingled with cells and other waste products in samples from 150 of the participants. Chemical analyses revealed that the bulk of the particles were composed of either polyethylene, which is the most used plastic in the world and is often found in food packaging, shopping bags and medical tubing, or polyvinyl chloride, known more commonly as PVC or vinyl.\n\nMicroplastic particles (arrows) infiltrate a living immune cell called a macrophage that was removed from a fatty deposit in a study participant’s blood vessel.Credit: R. Marfella et al./N Engl J Med\n\nOn average, participants who had more microplastics in their plaque samples also had higher levels of biomarkers for inflammation, analyses revealed. That hints at how the particles could contribute to ill health, Brook says. If they help to trigger inflammation, they might boost the risk that a plaque will rupture, spilling fatty deposits that could clog blood vessels.\n\nCompared to participants who didn’t have microplastics in their plaques, participants who did were younger; more likely to be male; more likely to smoke and more likely to have diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Because the study included only people who required surgery to reduce stroke risk, it is unknown whether the link holds true in a broader population.\n\nBrook is curious about the 40% of participants who showed no evidence of microplastics in their plaques, especially given that it is nearly impossible to avoid plastics altogether. Study co-author Sanjay Rajagopalan, a cardiologist at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, says it’s possible that these participants behave differently or have different biological pathways for processing the plastics, but more research is needed.\n\nStalled progress\n\nThe study comes as diplomats try to hammer out a global treaty to eliminate plastic pollution. In 2022, 175 nations voted to create a legally binding international agreement, with a goal of finalizing it by the end of 2024.\n\nResearchers have fought for more input into the process, noting that progress on the treaty has been too slow.

Other factors that the researchers did not study, such as socio-economic status, could be driving ill health rather than the plastics themselves, they say.</p><h2>Plastic planet</h2><p>Scientists have found microplastics just about everywhere they&#8217;ve looked: <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01252-0\">in oceans</a>; in shellfish; in breast milk; in drinking water; wafting in the air; and falling with rain.</p><p>Such contaminants are not only ubiquitous but also long-lasting, often requiring centuries to break down.

However, just because they accumulate doesn&#8217;t mean they cause harm. Scientists have been worried about the health effects of microplastics for around 20 years, but what those effects are has proved difficult to evaluate rigorously, says Philip Landrigan, a paediatrician and epidemiologist at Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts.</p><p>Giuseppe Paolisso, an internal-medicine physician at the University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli in Caserta, Italy, and his colleagues knew that microplastics are attracted to fat molecules, so they were curious about whether the particles would build up in fatty deposits called plaques that can form on the lining of blood vessels. The team tracked 257 people undergoing a surgical procedure that reduces stroke risk by removing plaque from an artery in the neck.</p><h2>Blood record</h2><p>The researchers put the excised plaques under an electron microscope. They saw jagged blobs &#8212; evidence of microplastics &#8212; intermingled with cells and other waste products in samples from 150 of the participants. Chemical analyses revealed that the bulk of the particles were composed of either polyethylene, which is the most used plastic in the world and is often found in food packaging, shopping bags and medical tubing, or polyvinyl chloride, known more commonly as PVC or vinyl.</p>\n \n  \n  <img class=\"figure__image\" alt=\"Microscope image showing various black and white shapes, with arrows pointing to two jagged blobs.\" src=\"//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-024-00650-3/d41586-024-00650-3_26819308.jpg\">\n  \n   <p class=\"figure__caption u-sans-serif\">Microplastic particles (arrows) infiltrate a living immune cell called a macrophage that was removed from a fatty deposit in a study participant&#8217;s blood vessel.Credit: R. Marfella <i>et al./N Engl J Med</i></p>\n  \n \n<p>On average, participants who had more microplastics in their plaque samples also had higher levels of biomarkers for inflammation, analyses revealed. That hints at how the particles could contribute to ill health, Brook says. If they help to trigger inflammation, they might boost the risk that a plaque will rupture, spilling fatty deposits that could clog blood vessels.</p><p>Compared to participants who didn&#8217;t have microplastics in their plaques, participants who did were younger; more likely to be male; more likely to smoke and more likely to have diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Because the study included only people who required surgery to reduce stroke risk, it is unknown whether the link holds true in a broader population.</p><p>Brook is curious about the 40% of participants who showed no evidence of microplastics in their plaques, especially given that it is nearly impossible to avoid plastics altogether. Study co-author Sanjay Rajagopalan, a cardiologist at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, says it&#8217;s possible that these participants behave differently or have different biological pathways for processing the plastics, but more research is needed.</p><h2>Stalled progress</h2><p>The study comes as diplomats try to hammer out a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03793-3\">global treaty to eliminate plastic pollution</a>. In 2022, <a href=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/historic-day-campaign-beat-plastic-pollution-nations-commit-develop\">175 nations voted</a> to create a legally binding international agreement, with a goal of finalizing it by the end of 2024.</p><p>Researchers have fought for more input into the process, noting that progress on the treaty has been <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03579-1\">too slow</a>.

The issue is expected to worsen with climate change, as rising temperatures accelerate the breakdown of plastic products. Studies so far have found microplastics to be harmful in mice and have also detected them in different parts of the human body — like the placenta, liver, and lungs — but there has been less research showing how much microplastics actually affect people’s health.\n\n“There’s already a big awareness that microplastics are everywhere, in every geographic locale,” said Sanjay Rajagopalan, an author on the study and chief of cardiovascular medicine at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. What “we don’t know is do they have significant health effects and should we really worry about them? What are the long-term effects?”\n\nThe study included about 300 people in Italy who underwent carotid endarterectomies, a type of surgery to remove the buildup of fatty plaques in blood vessels. The accumulation of these plaques over time can block vessels and lead to heart attacks or strokes.\n\nThe plaques collected from the surgeries were frozen and then analyzed by the researchers. They used microscopic techniques and chemical analyses to find jagged pieces of plastic embedded in the plaques.\n\nSince previous research has suggested microplastics may increase inflammation, the researchers looked at markers of inflammation — including interleukin-18, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and TNF-α — and found that the amount of plastic pieces in plaques correlated with levels of these inflammatory markers.\n\nChangcheng Zhou, a professor at the University of California, Riverside, who wasn’t involved in the study, said a next step of this research could be to understand the mechanisms that could explain how the microplastics might increase inflammation and lead to heart problems. One avenue to investigate is whether chemicals from the plastics leached into the plaques, said Zhou, who studies the chemicals inside plastic products.\n\nThough the study is far from proving that microplastics cause heart problems, “this is a much-needed analysis,” said Tim O’Toole, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Louisville who also wasn’t involved in the study.\n\n“The problem of microplastics contamination is going to continue or get worse because of global climate change,” said O’Toole, who has been researching the effects of pollutants on heart outcomes. “The increased temperature will increase the breakdown of these contaminants, and they’ll be even more and more a problem in our water supplies, in the food chain.”",

In recent years, their ubiquity has become undeniable: They have been found in fresh snowfall in Antarctica and at the depths of the Marianas Trench, as well as in human blood; breast milk; urine; and placental, lung and liver tissue.\n\nDr. Raffaele Marfella — a cardiology researcher in the University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli’s department of advanced medical and surgical sciences in Naples, Italy, and the lead author of the new study — said that he and his colleagues initiated the study to look for new risk factors for cardiovascular disease.\n\nThey knew of the enormous amount of degraded plastic pollution contaminating the planet and wondered “whether plastic, in the form of micro- or nanoplastics, could also degrade our arteries,” Marfella said in an email. People can inhale and ingest the plastic particles. The plastic can also enter the body through skin.\n\nA blue rectangular piece of microplastic on the finger of a researcher in Tacoma, Wash. (Ted S. Warren / AP file )\n\nTo study the effects, they turned to a group of patients already scheduled to undergo surgery for a condition called carotid artery stenosis, in which plaque, or fatty deposits, blocks normal blood flow. The body’s two carotid arteries supply blood to the brain, face and neck. The researchers looked at plaque removed from 257 patients and tracked the patients’ health for an average of 34 months following the surgery.\n\nThey found plastic particles — mostly nanoplastics — in the plaque of 150 patients. At follow-up, nonfatal heart attack, nonfatal stroke or death from any cause occurred in 20% of those patients and in 7.5% of the patients without detectable plastic particles.\n\nAfter adjusting for age, sex, body mass index and health conditions such as diabetes and abnormal cholesterol, the patients with detectable levels of plastics had “nearly a five times greater risk of a cardiovascular event” than the other patients, Marfella said.\n\nNumerous experimental studies on cells and in animals have shown that the presence of these plastic particles increases diseases. One study published online in February in the Journal of Hazardous Materials found microplastics, for the first time, in human arteries.\n\nPrevious studies finding the tiny particles in human tissue were “pioneering,” said Dick Vethaak, a biologist and toxicologist at Utrecht University’s Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences and coordinator of the Dutch Microplastics and Human Health Consortium, but this study “is the first of its kind.”\n\n“It is the first one that looked at a large number of donors in so much detail” and the first to follow patients for years to track their health, said Vethaak, who wasn’t involved with the new study.\n\nHowever, this kind of observational study can show only an association between the plastic particles and heart attack, stroke or death. It cannot show that they caused these cardiovascular events. For that, researchers would need to conduct a randomized, controlled trial, but it would be unethical to intentionally expose people to potential toxins.\n\nNevertheless, the study offers some hints about the relationship between the presence of micro- and nanoplastics and heart disease, said Dr. Martha Gulati, director of preventive cardiology in the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles.\n\n“We know that cardiovascular disease, particularly myocardial infarction, is usually triggered by an inflammatory response,” Gulati said, using another term for heart attack. The Italian researchers measured markers for inflammation in patients and found that those markers increased as the level of plastics in the plaque rose.\n\nStill, “is the inflammation due to the nanoplastics or something else?” Gulati asked.\n\nBecause the study was carried out in a very specific group of patients, the results cannot be applied to the broader population. But it could pave the way for future studies.\n\n“This paper might provoke people to figure out if we can measure micro- and nanoplastics in the general population and then examine who goes on to develop cardiac events,” Gulati said.\n\nVethaak said similar studies are in the pipeline for other kinds of human tissue.\n\nThe researchers also noted the possibility that the plaque samples could have been contaminated in the lab.\n\n“Future studies performed with the use of clean rooms, where there is no plastic in any form except the material under study, might corroborate our observations,” they wrote in the paper.\n\n“I hope that this study, and more work that it triggers, helps us address our environment and cardiovascular health because I feel like this is something that really needs to be discussed,” Gulati said. “It gets very little attention.”\n\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

The researchers looked at plaque removed from 257 patients and tracked the patients&#8217; health for an average of 34 months following the surgery.</p><p>They found plastic particles &#8212; mostly nanoplastics &#8212; in the plaque of 150 patients. At follow-up, nonfatal heart attack, nonfatal stroke or death from any cause occurred in 20% of those patients and in 7.5% of the patients without detectable plastic particles.</p><p>After adjusting for age, sex, body mass index and health conditions such as diabetes and abnormal cholesterol, the patients with detectable levels of plastics had &#8220;nearly a five times greater risk of a cardiovascular event&#8221; than the other patients, Marfella said.</p><p>Numerous experimental studies on cells and in animals have shown that the presence of these plastic particles increases diseases. One study published online in February in the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304389424004345\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link \">Journal of Hazardous Materials</a> found microplastics, for the first time, in human arteries.</p><p>Previous studies finding the tiny particles in human tissue were &#8220;pioneering,&#8221; said Dick Vethaak, a biologist and toxicologist at Utrecht University&#8217;s Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences and coordinator of the Dutch Microplastics and Human Health Consortium, but this study &#8220;is the first of its kind.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;It is the first one that looked at a large number of donors in so much detail&#8221; and the first to follow patients for years to track their health, said Vethaak, who wasn&#8217;t involved with the new study.</p><p>However, this kind of observational study can show only an association between the plastic particles and heart attack, stroke or death. It cannot show that they caused these cardiovascular events. For that, researchers would need to conduct a randomized, controlled trial, but it would be unethical to intentionally expose people to potential toxins.</p><p>Nevertheless, the study offers some hints about the relationship between the presence of micro- and nanoplastics and heart disease, said Dr. Martha Gulati, director of preventive cardiology in the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles.</p><p>&#8220;We know that cardiovascular disease, particularly myocardial infarction, is usually triggered by an<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/heart-health/high-levels-niacin-may-increase-heart-disease-risk-know-b-vitamin-rcna139249\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link \"> inflammatory response</a>,&#8221; Gulati said, using another term for heart attack. The Italian researchers measured markers for inflammation in patients and found that those markers increased as the level of plastics in the plaque rose.</p><p>Still, &#8220;is the inflammation due to the nanoplastics or something else?&#8221; Gulati asked.</p><p>Because the study was carried out in a very specific group of patients, the results cannot be applied to the broader population. But it could pave the way for future studies.</p><p>&#8220;This paper might provoke people to figure out if we can measure micro- and nanoplastics in the general population and then examine who goes on to develop cardiac events,&#8221; Gulati said.</p><p>Vethaak said similar studies are in the pipeline for other kinds of human tissue.</p><p>The researchers also noted the possibility that the plaque samples could have been&#160; contaminated in the lab.</p><p>&#8220;Future studies performed with the use of clean rooms, where there is no plastic in any form except the material under study, might corroborate our observations,&#8221; they wrote in the paper.</p><p>&#8220;I hope that this study, and more work that it triggers, helps us address our environment and cardiovascular health because I feel like this is something that really needs to be discussed,&#8221; Gulati said. &#8220;It gets very little attention.&#8221;</p><p>This article was originally published on <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/microplastics-nanoplastics-plaque-carotid-artery-heart-disease-rcna142067\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link \">NBCNews.com</a></p><p id=\"view-cmts-cta-0561b292-c11b-37c3-978e-d31b4ad3790b\" class=\"view-cmts-cta-wrapper\"></p></div>",

Marfella and his colleagues wondered whether plastic pollution might be involved in damaging people’s blood vessels by driving inflammation.\n\nWriting in the New England Journal of Medicine, the doctors describe how they analysed fatty plaques removed from 304 patients with atherosclerosis affecting the carotid arteries. The carotid arteries are the main blood vessels that supply blood to the neck, face and brain. The disease causes a build-up of plaque in the arteries, which substantially raises the risk of stroke. The plaques can be removed by a procedure called carotid endarterectomy.\n\nLab tests on the extracted plaques revealed polyethylene in 150 patients and polyvinyl chloride in 31, alongside signs of inflammation. On examination under an electron microscope, the researchers spotted jagged foreign particles in the fatty deposits, most less than a thousandth of a millimetre across.\n\nThe doctors followed 257 of the patients for an average of 34 months after they had carotid plaques removed. Those who had plastic particles in their plaques were 4.5 times more likely to have a stroke or heart attack, or to die from any cause, than those whose plaques were free from plastic pollution.\n\nMarfella said the discovery of plastics in the plaques was “surprising” and that the likely effect on cardiovascular health was “worrisome”. The findings may explain what doctors call “residual cardiovascular risk”, he said, where 20%-30% of patients who have been treated for common risk factors, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, still go on to have heart attacks and strokes.\n\nFurther work is needed to confirm whether plastic pollution plays a role in strokes and heart attacks, but Marfella called for greater awareness of the potential threat.\n\n“People must become aware of the risks we are taking with our lifestyle,” he said. “I hope the alarm message from our study will raise the consciousness of citizens, especially governments, to finally become aware of the importance of the health of our planet. To put it in a slogan that can unite the need for health for humans and the planet, plastic-free is healthy for the heart and the Earth.”\n\nHolly Shiels, professor of integrative physiology at the University of Manchester, said the impact of micro- and nanoplastics on plaque formation and coronary heart disease needed greater attention. “It is conceivable that microplastics and nanoplastics, and the toxins they carry, could trigger events leading to the development of atherosclerosis,” she said.",
