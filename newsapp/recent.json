        "newstext": "CNN —\n\nDemocratic Rep. Adam Schiff and Republican Steve Garvey have advanced to the general election in the open primary for California’s open Senate seat, setting up an uphill battle for the state’s beleaguered GOP.\n\nSchiff and Garvey were competing in two Senate contests Tuesday: one to fill the remainder of the late Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s term, from November until January; and another for a full six-year term beginning January 2025.\n\nThe incumbent senator, Democrat Laphonza Butler, was appointed to the seat last fall after Feinstein’s death. Butler announced shortly after that she would not seek a full term.\n\nUnder California’s open primary system, all candidates run on the same ballot, and the top two vote-getters, regardless of party, move on to the general election. In a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans nearly 2-to-1, the seat is heavily favored to stay blue in November.\n\nGarvey beat two Democratic congresswomen – Reps. Katie Porter and Barbara Lee – to secure a place on the general election ballot, despite raising a fraction of what his opponents did and airing no TV ads.\n\nIn the final weeks of the campaign, Schiff and his allies spent millions on ads attacking Garvey as “too conservative” for California – a move strategists said was meant to boost Republican turnout. Garvey, who raised just $2.1 million through February 14, compared with Schiff’s $31 million, did not spend any money on TV ads.\n\nSome progressives argued that, by encouraging more Republicans to vote, Schiff’s strategy would inadvertently lead to higher GOP turnout in down-ballot races. Porter called the ad strategy “brazenly cynical” and accused Schiff of misrepresenting how conservative Garvey is – the former baseball player voted for Donald Trump twice but has left the door open to voting for President Joe Biden in 2024.\n\nBut Porter also started highlighting another Republican, businessman Eric Early, in digital ads and during the final Senate debate, arguing that he was the real pro-Trump candidate in the race. The move was seen as an effort to split the Republican vote.\n\nPorter defended her attacks on Early, arguing that Schiff was being misleading about Garvey’s record while she was setting the record straight.\n\nDuring the general election, Schiff will likely continue to emphasize his profile as one of the chief Trump antagonists in the House, a role bolstered by his work on the former president’s impeachment and various other Trump investigations. Last year, Republicans removed Schiff from the House Intelligence Committee and voted to censure him over his role investigating the former president, which Schiff called a “badge of honor.”\n\nGarvey will face new pressure to fundraise and more clearly lay out what policies he supports. In primary debates, he often deferred on where he stood on key issues and tried to straddle the line between supporting Trump and distancing himself from the former president.\n\nSchiff, Porter and Lee entered the race early last year, while Garvey launched his campaign in October.\n\nFeinstein, who held the seat for more than 30 years, announced last February that she would not seek re-election. She died in September at age 90.",

                "publisher": "Fox News",
                "newstext": "California Democrat Katie Porter took a swipe at Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and special interest groups after losing the open Senate primary, suggesting that Schiff's campaign spent millions \"peddling lies\" and ultimately boosted the Republican in the race, former baseball player Steve Garvey, on Super Tuesday.\n\n\"We're standing three to one in TV spending and an onslaught of billionaires who spent millions peddling lies,\" Porter said in her concession speech Tuesday night. \"And our opponent's spending more to boost the Republican than promoting his own campaign.\"\n\n\"While the votes are still coming in, we know that tonight we’ll come up short,\" Porter said just after 9 p.m. Tuesday. \"Our opponents threw everything — every trick, millions of dollars, every trick in the playbook — to knock us off our feet. But I’m still standing in high heels.\"\n\nShe added, \"Because of you, we have the establishment running scared.\"\n\nTREY GOWDY FIRES BACK AT KATIE PORTER, CNN WRITER'S RESPONSE TO LAKEN RILEY MURDER: 'DO NOT LECTURE US'\n\nPorter, a progressive Democrat who has been representing Orange County since 2019, later said in her speech she \"never considered\" running for office \"until [Donald] Trump was elected\" in 2016. She rose to popularity helped by viral moments questioning Big Pharma CEOs during congressional hearings and publicly defied big corporate campaign backing.\n\nHowever, Porter herself has received millions of dollars from big donors to boost her campaign, despite touting her record of not accepting corporate PAC money. She has reportedly accepted thousands of dollars in donations from big Wall Street donors, according to federal campaign finance disclosures.\n\nAdditionally, according to Open Secrets — a nonprofit that tracks government campaigns — Porter received just over $50,000 in PAC donations, more than $32,000 from Apple and Google, more than $58,000 collectively from the Universities of California San Francisco and Irvine, just under $16,000 from Kaiser Permanente and over $600,000 from lawyers and law firms.\n\nADAM SCHIFF COULD UNITE CALIFORNIANS IN SENATE BID, BUT TO GOP CANDIDATE'S BENEFIT: KEVIN MCCARTHY\n\nPorter raised just under $28 million in her Senate campaign, trailing slightly behind Schiff's $31 million. Rep. Barbara Lee, another Democrat seeking the open Senate seat, raised $4 million, and Republican Garvey raised just over $2 million. Under California's primary system, the top two candidates in the primary election will face off in the general election in November.\n\nAccording to a Washington Post report last month, Porter also redirected at least half a million dollars in ads attacking another GOP contender, Eric Early, describing him as a \"100% pro-Trump candidate\" who is \"way more dangerous than Steve Garvey.\"\n\nThe highly contested seat was held for more than 30 years by former Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., until her death last year, prompting Gov. Gavin Newsom to appoint Democrat Sen. Laphonza Butler to fill the vacancy.\n\nAhead of Tuesday's election, Schiff, a Burbank Democrat and congressman since 2001, spent millions of dollars on campaign ads describing Garvey as someone who \"voted for Trump, twice, and supported Republicans for years, including far right conservatives,\" according to one ad.\n\nThe move to paint long-shot Republican opponent Garvey as a staunch Trump ally was seen as an effort to squeeze out Porter and Lee from the race — giving Schiff a higher likelihood of winning the general election instead of splitting the vote between Democrats in the deep blue bastion.\n\nADAM SCHIFF ENDORSED FOR SENATE AS 'TEAM PLAYER' BY LA TIMES: 'PRACTICED IN THE ART OF COMPROMISE'\n\nGarvey and Schiff will face off in the fall. Schiff is expected to win, but Garvey said during his victory speech on Tuesday, \"They say in the general election we’re going to strike out. That’s from the crowd that believes in the status quo.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSchiff, whose victory speech was interrupted by protesters calling for a cease-fire in the Israel-Palestine conflict, said, \"We are so lucky, so lucky to live in a democracy where we all have the right to protest.\"\n\n\"We are so lucky to live in that kind of democracy, and we want to make sure we keep this kind of democracy,\" he said.\n\nFox News Digital has reached out to Schiff, Lee, Porter and Garvey's campaigns for comment.",

        "newstext": "NEW YORK (AP) — Nikki Haley suspended her presidential campaign on Wednesday after being soundly defeated across the country on Super Tuesday, leaving Donald Trump as the last remaining major candidate for the 2024 Republican nomination.\n\nHaley didn’t endorse the former president in a speech in Charleston, South Carolina. Instead, she challenged him to win the support of the moderate Republicans and independent voters who supported her.\n\n“It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the votes of those in our party and beyond it who did not support him. And I hope he does that,” she said. “At its best, politics is about bringing people into your cause, not turning them away. And our conservative cause badly needs more people.”\n\nHaley, a former South Carolina governor and U.N. ambassador, was Trump’s first significant rival when she jumped into the race in February 2023. She spent the final phase of her campaign aggressively warning the GOP against embracing Trump, whom she argued was too consumed by chaos and personal grievance to defeat President Joe Biden in the general election.\n\nHer departure clears Trump to focus solely on his likely rematch in November with Biden. The former president is on track to reach the necessary 1,215 delegates to clinch the Republican nomination later this month.\n\nHaley’s defeat marks a painful, if predictable, blow to those voters, donors and Republican Party officials who opposed Trump and his fiery brand of “Make America Great Again” politics. She was especially popular among moderates and college-educated voters, constituencies that will likely play a pivotal role in the general election. It’s unclear whether Trump, who recently declared that Haley donors would be permanently banned from his movement, can ultimately unify a deeply divided party.\n\nHaley planned to address donors on a Zoom meeting Wednesday afternoon, according to two people familiar with the plans.\n\nTrump on Tuesday night declared that the GOP was united behind him, but in a statement shortly afterward, Haley spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas said, “Unity is not achieved by simply claiming, ‘We’re united.’”\n\n“Today, in state after state, there remains a large block of Republican primary voters who are expressing deep concerns about Donald Trump,” Perez-Cubas said. “That is not the unity our party needs for success. Addressing those voters’ concerns will make the Republican Party and America better.”\n\nRepublican presidential candidate former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley makes comments at a campaign event in Forth Worth, Texas, Monday, March 4, 2024. (AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez)\n\nHaley has made clear she doesn’t want to serve as Trump’s vice president or run on a third-party ticket arranged by the group No Labels. She leaves the race with an elevated national profile that could help her in a future presidential run.\n\nSwiftly following her speech Wednesday, Trump’s campaign in a fundraising email falsely claimed that Haley had endorsed his candidacy and did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the message. Earlier this week, Haley said she no longer feels bound by a pledge that required all GOP contenders to support the party’s eventual nominee in order to participate in the primary debates.\n\nIn a social media post, Trump continued to mock his former rival, while at the same time extending an invitation to “all of the Haley supporters to join the greatest movement in the history of our Nation. BIDEN IS THE ENEMY, HE IS DESTROYING OUR COUNTRY,” he wrote. “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!”\n\nHaley will suspend campaign, sources say Republican Nikki Haley will suspend her campaign. AP correspondent Julie Walker reports.\n\nOn Wednesday, Biden welcomed any voters who had backed Haley, acknowledging Trump’s previous rejection of her supporters.\n\n“Donald Trump made it clear he doesn’t want Nikki Haley’s supporters. I want to be clear: There is a place for them in my campaign,” Biden said in a statement. “I know there is a lot we won’t agree on. But on the fundamental issues of preserving American democracy, on standing up for the rule of law, on treating each other with decency and dignity and respect, on preserving NATO and standing up to America’s adversaries, I hope and believe we can find common ground.”\n\nA group that had targeted independents and Democrats to vote for Haley over Trump in Republican primaries is now pushing those voters to back Biden in November. On Wednesday, Primary Pivot said it was “pivoting” again with a new initiative — Haley Voters for Biden — which might ultimately amount to basically encouraging Democrats to revert back to supporting their party’s likely eventual nominee.\n\nBy staying in the campaign until now, Haley drew enough support from suburbanites and college-educated voters to highlight Trump’s apparent weaknesses with those groups.\n\nIn AP VoteCast surveys conducted among Republican primary and caucus voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, between 61% and 76% of Haley’s supporters said they would be so dissatisfied if Trump became the GOP nominee that they wouldn’t vote for him in the November general election. Voters in the early Republican head-to-head contests who said they wouldn’t vote for Trump in the fall represented a small but significant segment of the electorate: 2 in 10 Iowa voters, one-third of New Hampshire voters, and one-quarter of South Carolina voters.\n\nHaley leaves the 2024 presidential contest having made history as the first woman to win a Republican primary contest. She beat Trump in the District of Columbia on Sunday and in Vermont on Tuesday.\n\nShe had insisted she would stay in the race through Super Tuesday and crossed the country campaigning in states holding Republican contests. Ultimately, she was unable to knock Trump off his glide path to a third straight nomination.\n\nHaley’s allies note that she exceeded most of the political world’s expectations by making it as far as she did.\n\nShe had initially ruled out running against Trump in 2024. But she changed her mind and ended up launching her bid three months after he did, citing among other things the country’s economic troubles and the need for “generational change.” Haley, 52, later called for competency tests for politicians over the age of 75 — a knock on both Trump, who is 77, and Biden, who is 81.\n\nHer candidacy was slow to attract donors and support, but she ultimately outlasted all of her other GOP rivals, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former Vice President Mike Pence and Sen. Tim Scott, her fellow South Carolinian whom she appointed to the Senate in 2012. And the money flowed in until the very end. Her campaign said it raised more than $12 million in February alone.\n\nShe gained popularity with many Republican donors, independent voters and the “Never Trump” crowd, even though she criticized the criminal cases against him as politically motivated and pledged that, if president, she would pardon him if he were convicted in federal court.\n\n___\n\nAdriana Gomez Licon in Charleston, South Carolina, and Thomas Beaumont in Des Moines, Iowa, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nKinnard reported from Washington.

Voters in the early Republican head-to-head contests who said they wouldn&#8217;t vote for Trump in the fall represented a small but significant segment of the electorate: 2 in 10 Iowa voters, one-third of New Hampshire voters, and one-quarter of South Carolina voters.</p>\n    <p class=\"SovrnAd Advertisement \"></p>\n\n<p>Haley leaves the 2024 presidential contest having made history as the first woman to win a Republican primary contest.

                "newstext": "Photo: Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n\nOn Wednesday, Nikki Haley bowed to inevitability and ended her bid for president. The GOP is Donald Trump’s party again. There is no room for Haley, and perhaps not for her voters, either, though she maintains a show of defiance. She said she had no regrets as she left the race and declined to endorse Trump, who she said would have to earn her voters. Trump responded by “inviting” Haley supporters to join his movement, and Biden did the same, albeit in a more coherent statement. In a presidential race with razor-thin margins, Haley voters could be consequential. It’s less clear if the same can be said of Haley herself. Haley’s lackluster campaign never offered much of a challenge to Trump — and couldn’t with her at the helm.\n\nBy challenging Trump, she took on the reactionary forces he represents. In theory, that could have been brave. In reality, it meant little. There is hardly any daylight between Trump and Haley, who served as his ambassador to the United Nations. She is a far-right Republican and was a comfortable fit in Trump’s administration. Though she attacked Trump over his morals and age toward the end of her campaign, the delay looked opportunistic. Her campaign often more resembled a brand-building effort than an anti-Trump crusade. Nowhere was that more apparent than in her approach to gender.\n\nHaley tried to avoid liberal identity politics as she campaigned, but she emphasized her femininity when it suited her. She joked about her high heels and played Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers’ “American Girl” and “Woman in the White House” by Sheryl Crow after her rallies, Politico reported. She called her male opponents “the fellas.” On the campaign trail, she attacked rights for transgender people by adopting a pseudo-feminist tone. Women, she told NBC News, “are being told their voices don’t matter.” Yet she danced away from gender, too, in an attempt to placate a skeptical Republican base. “Think of the fact that you might be making history in this moment,” she told voters ahead of the Iowa caucuses. “And I’m not talking about history of a female president. I’m talking about history saying we are going to finally right the ship in America. We’re finally going to get it right.”\n\nOn abortion, Haley’s dance proved uniquely ineffective. She bolstered her anti-abortion credentials with her record as a South Carolina lawmaker and later as governor, in addition to personal stories about her fertility struggles and her husband’s adoption out of foster care. When the Alabama state supreme court ruled that frozen embryos were children, she initially said she agreed. At the same time, she called for a “consensus” on abortion, and she has said that she doesn’t judge people for being “pro-choice.” Haley looked vague and even indecisive to some in her own party. Jason Hennessey, the president of New Hampshire Right to Life, told the Washington Post in January that he saw Trump “with his Supreme Court justices … moving the ball forward and not using our tax dollars to support the abortion industry.” He added, “I guess I don’t know a lot about what Nikki has done.”\n\nAs Haley wavered between girl-power enthusiasm and traditional anti-feminism, she followed a path set out by previous generations of conservative women. But as she learned, today’s GOP is Trump’s GOP. Trump’s open misogyny emboldens older forces within the party and the conservative movement to which it is bound. A voter in North Carolina summed it up neatly: A woman can’t be president because she’s got no balls to scratch, he told NBC. “All a woman’s good for in my book is having babies and taking care of the house,” he added, describing himself as “old school.” Although his views are extreme, they’re legibly conservative — and no more misogynistic than anything Trump has done or espoused.\n\nThere is room, then, for women in the Republican Party, but only if they obey. These days, their subservience to Trump enables their rise. (To give Haley some credit, she is no Elise Stefanik.) The great irony of her situation is that she may not be able to face up to it. She had just enough boldness to take on Trump, whether she did so out of cynicism or out of idealistic conviction, but she never had the courage to shed the anti-feminism of her party and challenge his misogyny. She is still caught in a trap that she set for herself.",

She had just enough boldness to take on Trump, whether she did so out of cynicism or out of idealistic conviction, but she never had the courage to shed the anti-feminism of her party and challenge his misogyny. She is still caught in a trap that she set for herself.</p>\n\n  \n  <h3 class=\"title\">Sign Up for the Intelligencer&#160;Newsletter</h3>\n          <p class=\"description\">Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.</p>\n        \n          \n          \n            Email\n             \n          \n          <p>\n            <p class=\"return-message\" tabindex=\"-1\"></p>\n          </p>\n        \n      <p class=\"newsletter-flex-text-divider\"></p>\n      <a></a><a></a><p>This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google <a href=\"https://policies.google.com/privacy\">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=\"https://policies.google.com/terms\">Terms of Service</a> apply.</p>\n        <p class=\"expanded-terms \">By submitting your email, you agree to our <a href=\"https://nymag.com/newyork/terms/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Terms</a> and <a href=\"https://nymag.com/newyork/privacy/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Privacy Notice</a> and to receive email correspondence from us.</p>\n      \n\n\n    </div>",

                "title": "Crew members killed for first time in Houthi attack on commercial ship near Yemen, US officials say",
                "publisher": "CNN",
                "newstext": "CNN —\n\nA Houthi ballistic missile attack on a commercial ship in the Gulf of Aden resulted in at least two fatalities among the crew members, two US officials told CNN, marking the first time that the Iran-backed militant group has killed anyone as part of their ongoing attacks on ships transiting the Red Sea.\n\nThe attack struck the M/V True Confidence, a Barbados-flagged, Liberian-owned bulk carrier, the officials said. The ship has since been abandoned and coalition warships are now in the area assessing the situation, the officials said. At least six other crew members were injured, one of the officials said.\n\nThe attack happened around 11:30 am Sanaa time, or around 3:30 a.m. ET, one of the officials said. The strike marks a significant escalation of the Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping, which began in October in response to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nThe Houthis said in a statement that the strike was “accurate” and caused a fire to break out on the ship.\n\n“The targeting operation came after the ship’s crew rejected warning messages from the Yemeni naval forces,” a Houthi statement about the attack read.\n\nThe Houthi statement reiterated the group’s support for the Palestinian people and said they will not stop the attacks in the Red Sea until the Israeli “aggression stops and the siege on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is lifted.”\n\nThe British Embassy in Sanaa said at least two “innocent sailors” had died in the attack in a post to X.\n\nState Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Wednesday that the deaths were “sadly inevitable.”\n\n“The Houthis have continued to launch these reckless attacks with no regard for the well-being of innocent civilians who are transiting through the Red Sea, and now they have unfortunately and tragically killed innocent civilians,” Miller said at a department briefing.\n\n‘The United States will continue to hold the Houthis accountable for their attacks, which have not just disrupted international commerce, not just disrupted the freedom of navigation and international waters, and not just endangered seafarers, but now tragically killed a number of them,” he said.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 45 missile and drone attacks against commercial and US and coalition Naval vessels operating in the Red Sea, according to US and western officials, most of which have been intercepted by US or coalition destroyers or landed harmlessly in the water.\n\nTo date, no military vessels have been impacted by Houthi UAVs or missiles, according to Defense Department spokesperson Maj. Pete Nguyen. But more than a dozen commercial ships, including several US vessels, have been hit since October, Nguyen said.\n\nThe US and UK have also carried out four rounds of strikes against Houthi targets inside Yemen since January, hitting targets including weapons storage facilities, missile storage facilities, one-way attack unmanned aerial systems, air defense systems, radars, and helicopters used by the rebel group.\n\nUS Central Command forces have also been regularly conducting dynamic strikes against Houthi missiles seen preparing to launch from inside Yemen.\n\nThe Biden administration has been struggling to stop the attacks, however, and the group has been continuing to fortify its weapons stockpile inside Yemen, CNN previously reported.\n\nMultiple officials told CNN that the US still does not have “a denominator” that would allow them to assess the percentage of Houthi equipment the US and UK have actually destroyed in airstrikes, and it is not clear whether the US will shift its military approach further.\n\n“We know that the Houthis maintain a large arsenal,” Deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said last week, hours after the Houthis hit yet another cargo vessel in the Gulf of Aden with ballistic missiles. “They are very capable, they have sophisticated weapons, and that’s because they continue to get them from Iran.”\n\n“They continue to surprise us,” said one senior defense official, referring to the Houthis. “We just don’t have a good idea of what they still have.”\n\nAnd despite a robust US and coalition presence in the Red Sea, which includes the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier and several US destroyers, the Houthi attacks have caused a massive drop in ships traveling through the Suez Canal.\n\nThe passage links the Red Sea with the Mediterranean Sea, allowing ships to cut thousands of miles off shipping routes instead of sailing around Africa. In the first half of February, the Suez Canal experienced a 42% drop in monthly transits and an 82% decrease in container tonnage from its peak in 2023, according to the United Nations.\n\nCNN’s Jennifer Hansler, Mostafa Salem and Sharon Braithwaite contributed reporting.",

        "newstext": "Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell announced Wednesday he will support Donald Trump for the presidency, a move that comes more than three years after they have last spoken and after the Kentucky Republican pointedly blamed Trump for the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\n“It is abundantly clear that former President Trump has earned the requisite support of Republican voters to be our nominee for President of the United States,” McConnell said in a statement. “It should come as no surprise that as nominee, he will have my support.”\n\nMcConnell’s announcement came just minutes after Trump’s final substantive primary challenger – former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley – said she would leave the race the morning after Super Tuesday, in which Trump dominated the races across the country.\n\nMcConnell’s support came after lengthy discussions for months between Chris LaCivita from the Trump campaign and longtime McConnell confidant Josh Holmes about opening communications between the two camps and - maybe most importantly - getting on the same page about the US Senate races this year, according to a source familiar.\n\nMcConnell, who hasn’t spoken to Trump since December 2020, didn’t speak to him before he issued his endorsement, according to another source familiar with the matter. The source said that LaCivita and Holmes spoke instead.\n\nThe public support from McConnell, who announced last week he would step down as GOP leader at the end of the year, also came after his other top Republican senators have endorsed Trump. John Thune, the No. 2 Republican in the chamber who is running to replace McConnell, endorsed Trump earlier this month. Texas Sen. John Cornyn, another possible McConnell successor, backed Trump after he won the New Hampshire primary.\n\nThune, who has been vocal in the past about his concerns over how Trump will fare with suburban voters, told CNN that he believes the Republican ticket will deliver a united message.\n\n“I think we got to, gonna have a united ticket going into the fall. and we’ll all go out and all help aggressively win those people in suburban areas, independent voters,” he told CNN. “It’s now a – it’s a straight up one on one.”\n\nOther congressional Republicans are also setting aside past concerns over Trump as the party’s nominee and rallying behind him.\n\nRep. John Duarte, a California Republican who represents a district Joe Biden won last cycle, told CNN that he’s focused on who he is running against and that he plans to endorse Trump.\n\n“I think Biden’s the opponent and that’s good for me. It’s easy to run against Joe Biden these days and that’s what we’ll be doing,” he told CNN when asked if Trump at the top of the ticket could have implications for tough races down ballot.\n\nDuarte added that he “probably won’t” campaign with Trump but that he doesn’t think he needs to distance himself from him and that he’ll be endorsing the former president.\n\n“I will be, he’s our Republican nominee for president and we have to stop the Biden failures,” he told CNN. “So many people in my district of all, of all backgrounds, want to see these policies ended. That we need to drill American oil, we need to get water on the farms, we need to get affordability and opportunity back in America.”\n\nAnd GOP Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, who represents a Biden won Pennsylvania district, declined to say whether he would be endorsing Trump.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN’s Dana Bash and Sam Fossum contributed to this report.",

This decision comes after extensive communication between Trump's and McConnell's camps, primarily through Chris LaCivita and Josh Holmes. Despite their past conflict, McConnell's endorsement follows a similar move by other top Republican senators. Other congressional Republicans, including those representing Biden-won districts, are setting aside earlier concerns and rallying behind Trump, believing he will strengthen their chances in the face of President Biden's opposition.",

Nikki Haley – said she would leave the race the morning after Super Tuesday, in which Trump dominated the races across the country.\n\nMcConnell’s support came after lengthy discussions for months between Chris LaCivita from the Trump campaign and longtime McConnell confidant Josh Holmes about opening communications between the two camps and - maybe most importantly - getting on the same page about the US Senate races this year, according to a source familiar.\n\nMcConnell, who hasn’t spoken to Trump since December 2020, didn’t speak to him before he issued his endorsement, according to another source familiar with the matter. The source said that LaCivita and Holmes spoke instead.\n\nThe public support from McConnell, who announced last week he would step down as GOP leader at the end of the year, also came after his other top Republican senators have endorsed Trump. John Thune, the No. 2 Republican in the chamber who is running to replace McConnell, endorsed Trump earlier this month. Texas Sen. John Cornyn, another possible McConnell successor, backed Trump after he won the New Hampshire primary.\n\nThune, who has been vocal in the past about his concerns over how Trump will fare with suburban voters, told CNN that he believes the Republican ticket will deliver a united message.\n\n“I think we got to, gonna have a united ticket going into the fall. and we’ll all go out and all help aggressively win those people in suburban areas, independent voters,” he told CNN. “It’s now a – it’s a straight up one on one.”\n\nOther congressional Republicans are also setting aside past concerns over Trump as the party’s nominee and rallying behind him.\n\nRep.

                "newstext": "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) endorsed Donald Trump for president on Wednesday after years of acrimony between them, cementing Trump’s continued hold on the Republican Party. “It is abundantly clear that former President Trump has earned the requisite support of Republican voters to be our nominee for President of the United States,” McConnell said in a statement to The Washington Post. “It should come as no surprise that as nominee, he will have my support. During his presidency, we worked together to accomplish great things for the American people including tax reform that supercharged our economy and a generational change of our federal judiciary — most importantly, the Supreme Court. I look forward to the opportunity of switching from playing defense against the terrible policies the Biden administration has pursued to a sustained offense geared towards making a real difference in improving the lives of the American people.”\n\nMcConnell — who has announced he will step down from his leadership role in November — is one of the most influential Washington Republicans to back Trump, and the endorsement was a remarkable, if expected, move from the Kentucky Republican. He has held out in recent weeks as other Republicans have lined up to back Trump, including many who wanted a different nominee, and his endorsement means that almost every powerful cog in the Republican apparatus is directly behind the former president.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcConnell declared his endorsement as former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley announced Wednesday morning that she is suspending her campaign, leaving Trump with no remaining major opponents.\n\nMcConnell’s move is likely to have little effect with Trump’s supporters but could persuade Republican donors close to McConnell to contribute to Trump — and his words could matter to some of Trump’s critics in the party. McConnell has also faced pressure from some Republicans to endorse Trump, though people close to him said most of his supporters and allies were not clamoring for such a move. Biden recently called McConnell a “friend” in a statement, and the two men have spoken occasionally.\n\nA Trump adviser said he welcomed the endorsement, and the campaign believes it could help with some donors and Republicans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump needs to unite the Republican Party behind him, and Haley, while losing overwhelmingly to Trump, won 30 or 40 percent of the vote in many states. Many of her supporters are currently unwilling to back the former president, which could cause him problems in the general election, exit polls have shown.\n\nMcConnell has privately derided Trump, publicly attacked him for his role in fomenting the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and has not spoken with Trump for several years. People close to McConnell privately said after Trump’s presidency that the powerful Kentucky Republican did not plan to speak Trump’s name again.\n\n“There is no question, none, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the event of that day,” he said after Jan. 6. He added that Trump “didn’t get away with anything yet” in a speech on the floor of the Senate that explained his decision not to convict Trump on impeachment charges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump has mocked McConnell’s wife as “Coco Chao” because of her Asian American heritage and frequently derided McConnell as the “Broken Down Crow,” or in more pejorative terms. He has told advisers that he wanted to replace McConnell as the leader of Republicans in the Senate if he were elected, but McConnell has already said he will step down. During remarks to donors at his Mar-a-Lago Club in 2021, he infamously called McConnell a “dumb son of a b----.”\n\nBut in recent months, the two men have had a détente of sorts: Trump has not attacked McConnell, and Trump adviser Chris LaCivita and McConnell adviser Josh Holmes have spoken for several months about the possibility of an endorsement, as the New York Times first reported.\n\nMcConnell, who led an effort in Trump’s presidency to confirm hundreds of judges and three Supreme Court justices, is a ruthlessly pragmatic politician in many ways.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe two men, while never personally close, worked together on certain initiatives during Trump’s tenure, and McConnell often defended Trump. In a 2022 interview, he said his effort was to move the country “right of center” and that he worked closely with Trump, and primarily Trump’s appointees, to do just that.\n\n“Trump gets elected. I’m shocked. I’m absolutely shocked. As soon as I found out he won, the first thing that came to my mind was the Supreme Court,” McConnell said in a 2022 interview.\n\nBut he remained particularly critical of Trump over his role in the Jan. 6 attacks.\n\n“I feel exhilarated by the fact that this fellow finally, totally discredited himself,” McConnell told Jonathan Martin, one of the authors of a book called “This Will Not Pass,” when asked about his feelings right after Jan. 6.\n\nTrump, the Kentucky Republican said, “was pretty thoroughly discredited by this.”",
