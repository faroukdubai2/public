Children need to learn to recognise the letters they see, say their sounds and to hear them in words. The letters are introduced in an order that allows children to start building words right away, using sounding out and blending skills: they say the sound that each letter makes and blend them together to make words. Children can also begin to master the skill of segmenting, which is breaking words they hear into their separate letter sounds.\n\nAlphablocks is a step-by-step reading programme grouped neatly into five colour-coded levels.
