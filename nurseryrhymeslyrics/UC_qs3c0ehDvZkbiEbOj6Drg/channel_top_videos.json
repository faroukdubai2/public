It's a time to practice all the skills learned in level one and make sure that they are really secure before proceeding. This level rounds out children's knowledge of the alphabet, introducing letter names (A's name sounds like the a in ape, while her sound is like the start of apple) and capital letters.\n\nAlphablocks is a step-by-step reading programme grouped neatly into five colour-coded levels. Each level introduces new letters and letter teams along with new phonics ideas and key skills. Alphablocks uses best-practice systematic synthetic phonics developed with literacy experts and aligned to the EYSF (Early Years Foundation Stage) framework and KS1 curriculum. It is compatible with all major UK reading schemes and has helped millions of young children around the world to learn to read.\n\n---\n\nSubscribe for more Alphablocks Content: https://www.youtube.com/c/officialalphablocks?sub_confirmation=1\n\n---\n\nOfficial website:\nhttps://www.learningblocks.tv/alphablocks/home\n\nFor more, download the official Alphablocks apps:\n\nhttps://www.learningblocks.tv/alphablocks/apps\nAB World - https://onelink.to/5hjb4y\nAB Letter Fun - https://onelink.to/3tgtzz\nHow To Write - https://onelink.to/xx2wrb\nMeet the AB - https://onelink.to/fvq9j\n\nAs seen on CBeebies!

Children need to learn to recognise the letters they see, say their sounds and to hear them in words. The letters are introduced in an order that allows children to start building words right away, using sounding out and blending skills: they say the sound that each letter makes and blend them together to make words. Children can also begin to master the skill of segmenting, which is breaking words they hear into their separate letter sounds.\n\nAlphablocks is a step-by-step reading programme grouped neatly into five colour-coded levels.

Children need to learn to recognise the letters they see, say their sounds and to hear them in words. The letters are introduced in an order that allows children to start building words right away, using sounding out and blending skills: they say the sound that each letter makes and blend them together to make words. Children can also begin to master the skill of segmenting, which is breaking words they hear into their separate letter sounds.\n\nAlphablocks is a step-by-step reading programme grouped neatly into five colour-coded levels.
