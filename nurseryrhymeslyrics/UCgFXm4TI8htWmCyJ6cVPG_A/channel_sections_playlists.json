But even after splashing around, Ellie refuses to drink. Back inside, Eric sets up a science experiment, showing Ellie how plants thrive with water and wilt without it. Ellie finds it interesting but still declines the water. At bedtime, Eric tells Ellie an adventurous story of a brave girl who defeats a dragon with the power of water. Ellie enjoys the story but doesn't drink any water. That night, Ellie dreams of a scorching day where she's parched and realizes the importance of water. She wakes up, immediately drinks water, and exclaims, \"Wow, water IS important!\" The next day, while playing soccer with Charlotte and Eric, Ellie enthusiastically calls for a water break. \n\nLesson Learned:\nWater is essential for our well-being, and staying hydrated can make us feel energetic and healthy.\n\nSubscribe for notifications to new videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgFXm4TI8htWmCyJ6cVPG_A?sub_confirmation=1\n\nCheck out our latest videos playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsHnS3mZglg&list=PL5gq3QGk5j3hRwpMNKQ9L5NyUt3FiTmSy",

We will also cover some practical tips on how kids can develop good behavior and become better siblings.\n\nFirstly, we will discuss the importance of sibling relationships. Siblings play a significant role in a child's social development and can have a profound impact on their emotional and mental well-being. Positive relationships between siblings can help to build self-esteem, improve social skills, and foster a sense of empathy and compassion.\n\nWe also highlight the importance of older siblings in helping their younger siblings learn good behavior and become better individuals. In this video, we will provide tips on how older siblings can mentor their younger siblings and teach them valuable life skills, such as responsibility, empathy, and problem-solving.\n\nTo help foster positive sibling relationships, it is important for parents to encourage open communication and provide opportunities for siblings to spend quality time together. This can include activities such as playing board games, doing crafts, or even just having conversations about their day.\n\nIn addition to building strong relationships, it is also important for kids to develop good behavior and become better siblings. This can include behaviors such as sharing, showing empathy, and being respectful of each other's space and belongings.\n\nParents can help kids develop these behaviors by setting clear expectations and reinforcing positive behavior through praise and rewards. It is also important for parents to model good behavior themselves and encourage their children to practice good behavior in all aspects of their lives.\n\nSubscribe for notifications to new videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgFXm4TI8htWmCyJ6cVPG_A?sub_confirmation=1\n\nCheck out our latest videos playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsHnS3mZglg&list=PL5gq3QGk5j3hRwpMNKQ9L5NyUt3FiTmSy",

Let's do this!\n\nFirst things first, always make sure to get to the bus stop early and find a safe spot to wait. No playing tag or running around near the road, okay? Stay in a line, and make sure to stand back from the road so the driver can see you.\n\nWhen it's time to get on the bus, wait for the driver to give you the signal. Then, use the handrail and take one step at a time while getting on and off the bus. Don't forget to be careful and watch your step, superstars!\n\nOnce you're on the bus, quickly find a seat and sit facing forward like a champ. And if the bus has seatbelts, always wear them. Keep your hands, feet, and stuff to yourself and avoid bugging the driver. They need to focus on the road!\n\nWhile you're on the bus, stay in your seat and talk softly with your friends. No throwing things, yelling or causing trouble, okay? The school bus is not a playground, and we want to make sure everyone has a fun and safe ride.\n\nWhen it's time to get off the bus, make sure to wait until the bus comes to a complete stop. Use the handrail and take one step at a time while getting off the bus. Remember to look both ways before crossing the road, and never cross in front of the bus.\n\nSo there you have it, awesome kids! Following these super cool school bus rules will help make your ride to school the best one yet. Thanks for learning with us, and have a great day!\n\nThis video also features other funny videos about bus toys!\n\nSubscribe for notifications to new videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgFXm4TI8htWmCyJ6cVPG_A?sub_confirmation=1\n\nCheck out our latest videos playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsHnS3mZglg&list=PL5gq3QGk5j3hRwpMNKQ9L5NyUt3FiTmSy",

They learn that they must be responsible for their actions and learn how to behave like good kids. \n\nA timeout is a disciplinary measure used to control and manage a child's behavior. During a timeout, a child is asked to sit or stand in a designated area, away from the main activity or group, for a set period of time. The purpose of a timeout is to provide a \"cooling off\" period for the child, during which they can reflect on their behavior and learn to control their emotions. Timeouts are often used as a way to address minor misbehavior, such as talking back or not following rules\n\nGood kid behavior includes showing respect for authority figures and rules, being kind and considerate to others, being honest and trustworthy, taking responsibility for one's actions, being dependable and reliable, being self-disciplined and self-controlled, and being cooperative and willing to help others. It also includes following through with commitments and tasks, being organized and prepared, being positive and optimistic, and being open-minded and willing to learn.\n\nSubscribe for notifications to new videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgFXm4TI8htWmCyJ6cVPG_A?sub_confirmation=1\n\nCheck out our latest videos playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsHnS3mZglg&list=PL5gq3QGk5j3hRwpMNKQ9L5NyUt3FiTmSy\n\nDownload the Toys and Colors App: \nhttps://mobile.toysandcolors.com/youtube",

Here are some tips for helping kids to eat more healthily:\n\n1. Offer a variety of healthy foods: Children are more likely to eat a variety of healthy foods if they are available. Try to include a range of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and proteins in your child's diet.\n\n2. Make meals and snacks appealing: Presentation is important when it comes to getting kids to try new foods. Try cutting fruits and vegetables into fun shapes or serving them with dips or sauces.\n\n3. Set a good example: Children are more likely to eat healthy foods if they see their parents and other adults eating them as well. Be a good role model by eating a variety of healthy foods yourself.\n\n4. Involve kids in meal planning and preparation: Children are more likely to eat foods that they have helped to prepare. Involve them in planning and cooking meals and snacks.\n\n5. Offer healthy options at snack time: Instead of sugary snacks, try offering fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds as healthier alternatives.\n\n6. Limit sugary drinks: Instead of soda, offer water, milk, or 100% fruit juice as healthier beverage options.\n\n7. Don't make a big deal out of unhealthy foods: If you don't want your child to eat too many unhealthy foods, try not to make a big deal out of them. Children may be more likely to want unhealthy foods if they feel like they are being restricted.\nSubscribe for notifications to new videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgFXm4TI8htWmCyJ6cVPG_A?sub_confirmation=1\n\nCheck out our latest videos playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsHnS3mZglg&list=PL5gq3QGk5j3hRwpMNKQ9L5NyUt3FiTmSy\n\nDownload the Toys and Colors App: \nhttps://mobile.toysandcolors.com/youtube",

          "description": "Emma and Charlotte share their story for kids about swimming pool safety rules.\n\nHere are some general pool rules that you can teach children to help keep them safe while swimming:\n\n1. Always swim with a buddy. Children should never swim alone, as accidents can happen quickly, and having someone nearby can be lifesaving.\n\n2. Follow the \"touch\" rule. Children should always be within arm's reach of an adult or designated supervisor when in the pool.\n\n3. Follow the pool rules. Children should be taught to listen to and follow the rules set by the pool or pool staff, such as no running or no diving in shallow water.\n\n4. Wear appropriate swimwear. Children should wear swimsuits that fit properly and are made for swimming, rather than street clothes or underwear, which can be heavy and hinder movement in the water.\n\n5. Learn to float and swim. Children should be taught basic swimming skills such as floating and treading water, which can help them stay safe in the water.\n\n6. Know how to exit the pool safely. Children should be taught how to exit the pool safely, such as using the steps or ladder, and where to find the nearest exit in case of an emergency.\n\n7. Stay hydrated. Children should be encouraged to drink plenty of water before and after swimming to help prevent dehydration.\n\n8. Use sunscreen.

          "description": "Jannie, Wendy, and their friends share their favorite Toys and Colors videos about helping Santa on Christmas day!\n\nOn Christmas Eve, a group of eager and excited children decide to help Santa deliver presents to all the good boys and girls around the world. They put on their warmest winter clothes and head out into the cold night air, ready to lend a hand to the jolly old man in red.\n\nAs they make their way through the snow-covered streets, the kids are full of energy and cheer, spreading joy and cheer wherever they go. They carefully load up Santa's sleigh with presents, making sure to double-check their lists to make sure that everyone gets exactly what they asked for.\n\nAs the night wears on and the children become tired, Santa thanks them for their hard work and invites them to come back and help him again next year. The kids are thrilled at the prospect and can't wait to return and lend a helping hand to Santa once again.\n\nAs the sun rises on Christmas morning, the kids wake up to find that Santa has left each of them a special gift, as a thank-you for their help on this special night. They are overjoyed and can't wait to share their presents with their loved ones, knowing that they played a small part in spreading joy and cheer to children all around the world.\n\nSubscribe for notifications to new videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgFXm4TI8htWmCyJ6cVPG_A?sub_confirmation=1\n\nCheck out our latest videos playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsHnS3mZglg&list=PL5gq3QGk5j3hRwpMNKQ9L5NyUt3FiTmSy\n\nDownload the Toys and Colors App: \nhttps://mobile.toysandcolors.com/youtube",

          "description": "Wendy, Ellie, and Lyndon pretend play about cleaning up trash in the oceans to help the animals and environment! Toys and Colors teams up with #TeamSeas to help kids learn why it is important to keep our oceans free from trash. \n\n#TeamSeas is a global campaign to raise $30M to remove 30M pounds of plastic and trash from our ocean, rivers and beaches. $1 = 1 less pound of trash in our ocean when you donate to https://teamseas.org.\n\nWHAT‚ÄôS THE DEAL WITH PLASTIC POLLUTION IN OUR WATER?\nOur ocean, rivers and beaches are full of plastic trash. It‚Äôs estimated that there are 200M tons of plastic already circulating in marine environments, with an estimated 11M tons entering the ocean EVERY YEAR. Pollution from bottles, bags, straws and abandoned fishing gear is a health crisis for our entire planet. So we‚Äôre going to remove the equivalent of 85 football fields covered a foot deep in trash. \n\nWHY OCEANS, RIVERS AND BEACHES? \nThe ocean and the life within it are incredibly important. Aside from the water we drink, the ocean produces half the air we breathe every day. So it‚Äôs a no-brainer that keeping it clean and healthy is critical to our survival. But keeping our rivers and beaches free of trash pollution is just as \nimportant. Rivers contribute up to 20% of ocean plastic pollution overall. They are the arteries that carry waste from land to the ocean and it‚Äôs important we cut off that problem upstream. And trash on beaches can inevitably make its way into the water and harm coastal habitats, which is why we are focusing our attention on cleaning up all three. \n\nHOW ARE WE ACTUALLY GOING TO CLEAN UP ALL THIS TRASH? \nWe‚Äôre glad you asked. Because 30M pounds is A LOT of trash. We‚Äôre dividing our work among three points of intervention: beaches, rivers and oceans.\n\nBeaches\nWith the experts at Ocean Conservancy, we‚Äôll send professional crews to clean up some of the most iconic, vulnerable beaches on the planet. We‚Äôll also be holding safe, locally-hosted events leveraging Ocean Conservancy‚Äôs International Coastal Cleanup (ICC) network so #TeamSeas members can roll up their sleeves and see the impact they‚Äôre making firsthand, one pound of trash at a time. The ICC is the largest beach cleanup network in the world (more than 340 million pounds of trash have been collected from beaches in its 35 year history!) and with your help we‚Äôll make it even bigger.\n\nRivers\nFor our rivers, #TeamSeas will fund Interceptors‚Ñ¢, The Ocean Cleanup‚Äôs cutting-edge river cleanup technologies that collect trash before it can reach the ocean. The Ocean Cleanup has several Interceptor‚Ñ¢ solutions already deployed at some of the world‚Äôs most polluted rivers to catch plastic and trash upstream. #TeamSeas will support the expansion and continued operation of this work as The Ocean Cleanup takes aim at the 1% of rivers which contribute 80% of the trash flowing into the ocean from rivers.\n\nOceans\nLost, abandoned and discarded fishing gear ‚Äì or ghost gear ‚Äì is some of the deadliest ocean trash, and is super tricky to recover. #TeamSeas will work with Ocean Conservancy‚Äôs Global Ghost Gear Initiative¬Æ to go to ghost gear ‚Äúgraveyards,‚Äù where we‚Äôll identify and float the abandoned gear to the surface. From there it‚Äôll be hooked onto boat cranes and removed from the ocean forever.",

But this is no ordinary ride! üöó As he zooms around, the car changes colors, matching the different sections of the room. The team gives big thumbs up to this chameleon car until... uh-oh! Slime alert! ü§¢ The car gets stuck in a gooey mess, and so do their hands. Squish, squash, the slime play begins, and hey, they even find toys in the goop!\n\nJust when Auntie Beth remembers her chores and the kids recall their homework waiting back in the real world, they're thrown a twist: to leave this wacky place, they must collect four keys from four unique challenges. Time for a treasure hunt!\n\nEllie faces a balloon-popping frenzy, Andrea wades through a chocolate fountain (yum!), Auntie Beth braves the sizzling 'floor is lava' escapade, and Kaden, though a tad nervous, dives into a sea of green balls to grab the last elusive key. üóùÔ∏è\n\nWith teamwork and a sprinkle of courage, they conquer each task and gather the keys, unlocking their way back home. Phew, homework time! But just as they sigh in relief, that sneaky door glows again, hinting at future adventures. The end... or is it? üåü\n\nLesson Learned:\nOur rainbow squad learned that even when you're having a blast, responsibilities like chores and homework can't be forgotten. They also discovered that sometimes you have to face challenges head-on, even if they seem a little scary at first. By sticking together and using their smarts, they turned obstacles into thrilling quests and made it back to tackle their duties!\n\nSubscribe for notifications to new videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgFXm4TI8htWmCyJ6cVPG_A?sub_confirmation=1\n\nCheck out our latest videos playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsHnS3mZglg&list=PL5gq3QGk5j3hRwpMNKQ9L5NyUt3FiTmSy",

They're not just any dolls; they're clueless about everyday human activities like brushing teeth, eating breakfast, and even studying!\n\nFirst, Alex teaches them how to properly brush their teeth. But the fun doesn't stop there; it's breakfast time! Barbie Ellie and Ken Eric have a hard time navigating the simple task of eating cereal and drinking milk. Thanks to Alex's guidance, they slowly get the hang of it.\n\nThen it's playtime! They head to the backyard where Alex tries to teach them how to catch a ball and even ride a bike. They're a bit robotic at first but improve with practice. When it's study time, Alex has to teach them basic manners and how to focus. They make a mess with books and paper airplanes but eventually enjoy learning some basic math.\n\nAt bedtime, Alex discovers the dolls are sad because they want their own beds. No problem! Alex makes two new beds for them. They all say goodnight, looking forward to more adventures the next day. The next morning, the magic is gone, and the dolls have turned back to their original form, but the hope for another magical day remains!\n\nLesson Learned:\nThe lesson here is about the importance of patience and teaching others. Whether it's brushing teeth or learning to study, taking the time to show someone the ropes can be rewarding for everyone involved.\n\nSubscribe for notifications to new videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgFXm4TI8htWmCyJ6cVPG_A?sub_confirmation=1\n\nCheck out our latest videos playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsHnS3mZglg&list=PL5gq3QGk5j3hRwpMNKQ9L5NyUt3FiTmSy",

Stay in a line, and make sure to stand back from the road so the driver can see you.\n\nWhen it's time to get on the bus, wait for the driver to give you the signal. Then, use the handrail and take one step at a time while getting on and off the bus. Don't forget to be careful and watch your step, superstars!\n\nOnce you're on the bus, quickly find a seat and sit facing forward like a champ. And if the bus has seatbelts, always wear them. Keep your hands, feet, and stuff to yourself and avoid bugging the driver. They need to focus on the road!\n\nWhile you're on the bus, stay in your seat and talk softly with your friends. No throwing things, yelling or causing trouble, okay? The school bus is not a playground, and we want to make sure everyone has a fun and safe ride.\n\nWhen it's time to get off the bus, make sure to wait until the bus comes to a complete stop. Use the handrail and take one step at a time while getting off the bus. Remember to look both ways before crossing the road, and never cross in front of the bus.\n\nSo there you have it, awesome kids! Following these super cool school bus rules will help make your ride to school the best one yet. Thanks for learning with us, and have a great day!\n\nThis video also features other funny videos about bus toys!\n\nSubscribe for notifications to new videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgFXm4TI8htWmCyJ6cVPG_A?sub_confirmation=1\n\nCheck out our latest videos playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsHnS3mZglg&list=PL5gq3QGk5j3hRwpMNKQ9L5NyUt3FiTmSy",

They learn that they must be responsible for their actions and learn how to behave like good kids. \n\nA timeout is a disciplinary measure used to control and manage a child's behavior. During a timeout, a child is asked to sit or stand in a designated area, away from the main activity or group, for a set period of time. The purpose of a timeout is to provide a \"cooling off\" period for the child, during which they can reflect on their behavior and learn to control their emotions. Timeouts are often used as a way to address minor misbehavior, such as talking back or not following rules\n\nGood kid behavior includes showing respect for authority figures and rules, being kind and considerate to others, being honest and trustworthy, taking responsibility for one's actions, being dependable and reliable, being self-disciplined and self-controlled, and being cooperative and willing to help others. It also includes following through with commitments and tasks, being organized and prepared, being positive and optimistic, and being open-minded and willing to learn.\n\nSubscribe for notifications to new videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgFXm4TI8htWmCyJ6cVPG_A?sub_confirmation=1\n\nCheck out our latest videos playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsHnS3mZglg&list=PL5gq3QGk5j3hRwpMNKQ9L5NyUt3FiTmSy\n\nDownload the Toys and Colors App: \nhttps://mobile.toysandcolors.com/youtube",

Here are some tips for helping kids to eat more healthily:\n\n1. Offer a variety of healthy foods: Children are more likely to eat a variety of healthy foods if they are available. Try to include a range of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and proteins in your child's diet.\n\n2. Make meals and snacks appealing: Presentation is important when it comes to getting kids to try new foods. Try cutting fruits and vegetables into fun shapes or serving them with dips or sauces.\n\n3. Set a good example: Children are more likely to eat healthy foods if they see their parents and other adults eating them as well. Be a good role model by eating a variety of healthy foods yourself.\n\n4. Involve kids in meal planning and preparation: Children are more likely to eat foods that they have helped to prepare. Involve them in planning and cooking meals and snacks.\n\n5. Offer healthy options at snack time: Instead of sugary snacks, try offering fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds as healthier alternatives.\n\n6. Limit sugary drinks: Instead of soda, offer water, milk, or 100% fruit juice as healthier beverage options.\n\n7. Don't make a big deal out of unhealthy foods: If you don't want your child to eat too many unhealthy foods, try not to make a big deal out of them. Children may be more likely to want unhealthy foods if they feel like they are being restricted.\nSubscribe for notifications to new videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgFXm4TI8htWmCyJ6cVPG_A?sub_confirmation=1\n\nCheck out our latest videos playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsHnS3mZglg&list=PL5gq3QGk5j3hRwpMNKQ9L5NyUt3FiTmSy\n\nDownload the Toys and Colors App: \nhttps://mobile.toysandcolors.com/youtube",

          "description": "Emma and Charlotte share their story for kids about swimming pool safety rules.\n\nHere are some general pool rules that you can teach children to help keep them safe while swimming:\n\n1. Always swim with a buddy. Children should never swim alone, as accidents can happen quickly, and having someone nearby can be lifesaving.\n\n2. Follow the \"touch\" rule. Children should always be within arm's reach of an adult or designated supervisor when in the pool.\n\n3. Follow the pool rules. Children should be taught to listen to and follow the rules set by the pool or pool staff, such as no running or no diving in shallow water.\n\n4. Wear appropriate swimwear. Children should wear swimsuits that fit properly and are made for swimming, rather than street clothes or underwear, which can be heavy and hinder movement in the water.\n\n5. Learn to float and swim. Children should be taught basic swimming skills such as floating and treading water, which can help them stay safe in the water.\n\n6. Know how to exit the pool safely. Children should be taught how to exit the pool safely, such as using the steps or ladder, and where to find the nearest exit in case of an emergency.\n\n7. Stay hydrated. Children should be encouraged to drink plenty of water before and after swimming to help prevent dehydration.\n\n8. Use sunscreen. Children should be taught to use sunscreen to protect their skin from the sun's harmful UV rays, especially during peak hours of the day.\n\n9. Do not swallow pool water. Children should be taught not to drink or swallow pool water, as it can contain bacteria and other contaminants.\n\n10. Follow pool safety rules. Children should be taught to follow pool safety rules such as not pushing or horseplaying in the pool, and respecting the boundaries of designated swimming areas.\n\nBy teaching children these pool rules, you can help keep them safe and help them have a fun and enjoyable time at the pool.\n\nSubscribe for notifications to new videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgFXm4TI8htWmCyJ6cVPG_A?sub_confirmation=1\n\nCheck out our latest videos playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsHnS3mZglg&list=PL5gq3QGk5j3hRwpMNKQ9L5NyUt3FiTmSy\n\nDownload the Toys and Colors App: \nhttps://mobile.toysandcolors.com/youtube",

          "description": "Wendy, Ellie, and Lyndon pretend play about cleaning up trash in the oceans to help the animals and environment! Toys and Colors teams up with #TeamSeas to help kids learn why it is important to keep our oceans free from trash. \n\n#TeamSeas is a global campaign to raise $30M to remove 30M pounds of plastic and trash from our ocean, rivers and beaches. $1 = 1 less pound of trash in our ocean when you donate to https://teamseas.org.\n\nWHAT‚ÄôS THE DEAL WITH PLASTIC POLLUTION IN OUR WATER?\nOur ocean, rivers and beaches are full of plastic trash. It‚Äôs estimated that there are 200M tons of plastic already circulating in marine environments, with an estimated 11M tons entering the ocean EVERY YEAR. Pollution from bottles, bags, straws and abandoned fishing gear is a health crisis for our entire planet. So we‚Äôre going to remove the equivalent of 85 football fields covered a foot deep in trash. \n\nWHY OCEANS, RIVERS AND BEACHES? \nThe ocean and the life within it are incredibly important. Aside from the water we drink, the ocean produces half the air we breathe every day. So it‚Äôs a no-brainer that keeping it clean and healthy is critical to our survival. But keeping our rivers and beaches free of trash pollution is just as \nimportant. Rivers contribute up to 20% of ocean plastic pollution overall. They are the arteries that carry waste from land to the ocean and it‚Äôs important we cut off that problem upstream. And trash on beaches can inevitably make its way into the water and harm coastal habitats, which is why we are focusing our attention on cleaning up all three. \n\nHOW ARE WE ACTUALLY GOING TO CLEAN UP ALL THIS TRASH? \nWe‚Äôre glad you asked. Because 30M pounds is A LOT of trash. We‚Äôre dividing our work among three points of intervention: beaches, rivers and oceans.\n\nBeaches\nWith the experts at Ocean Conservancy, we‚Äôll send professional crews to clean up some of the most iconic, vulnerable beaches on the planet. We‚Äôll also be holding safe, locally-hosted events leveraging Ocean Conservancy‚Äôs International Coastal Cleanup (ICC) network so #TeamSeas members can roll up their sleeves and see the impact they‚Äôre making firsthand, one pound of trash at a time. The ICC is the largest beach cleanup network in the world (more than 340 million pounds of trash have been collected from beaches in its 35 year history!) and with your help we‚Äôll make it even bigger.\n\nRivers\nFor our rivers, #TeamSeas will fund Interceptors‚Ñ¢, The Ocean Cleanup‚Äôs cutting-edge river cleanup technologies that collect trash before it can reach the ocean. The Ocean Cleanup has several Interceptor‚Ñ¢ solutions already deployed at some of the world‚Äôs most polluted rivers to catch plastic and trash upstream. #TeamSeas will support the expansion and continued operation of this work as The Ocean Cleanup takes aim at the 1% of rivers which contribute 80% of the trash flowing into the ocean from rivers.\n\nOceans\nLost, abandoned and discarded fishing gear ‚Äì or ghost gear ‚Äì is some of the deadliest ocean trash, and is super tricky to recover. #TeamSeas will work with Ocean Conservancy‚Äôs Global Ghost Gear Initiative¬Æ to go to ghost gear ‚Äúgraveyards,‚Äù where we‚Äôll identify and float the abandoned gear to the surface. From there it‚Äôll be hooked onto boat cranes and removed from the ocean forever.",

          "description": "Wonka, the master chocolatier, is busy creating yummy chocolate delights. Suddenly, we see Oompa Loompa Maddie peeking with wide eyes from behind a candy machine, totally mesmerized by the chocolate!\n\nMaddie, with a hopeful smile, asks Wonka for some chocolate, but alas, Wonka says no, leaving Maddie a bit blue. But wait! There's a twist! Someone sneakily swipes some chocolate from Wonka's jar! Who could it be? Wonka is on the case!\n\nWith a catchy tune, \"Who stole the chocolate from the chocolate jar?\" echoing in the background, Wonka and Maddie turn into the coolest detective duo. They first zoom into Maddie's room, where she's experimenting with fruit and chocolate fountains, but nope, she's not the chocolate swiper.\n\nThe chocolate chase heats up! They meet the M&M man and Andrea dancing in a room full of chocolate. A quick check, and it's clear their chocolate isn't Wonka's. Next up, Wendy, who's crafting chocolate eggs, but again, they‚Äôre different from Wonka's missing treats.\n\nThe plot thickens until they find themselves in Strawberry Bear‚Äôs room. There, amidst a sea of chocolate strawberries, they spot Wonka's chocolate! Strawberry Bear, looking a tad guilty, admits to the sweet heist. But guess what? Wonka, with a heart as sweet as his chocolates, decides to turn this moment into a celebration of sharing!\n\nThe video wraps up with a joyous scene. Everyone's sharing and enjoying the delicious strawberry chocolate treats, dancing and laughing together. Wonka's message is clear: sharing not only brings happiness but also turns little mistakes into big smiles!\n\nLesson Learned:\nThis delightful tale teaches us the heartwarming lesson of sharing and kindness. Instead of getting upset, Wonka chooses to share his chocolate, spreading happiness and teaching everyone the magic of sharing and turning a little oops into oodles of joy!\n\nSubscribe for notifications to new videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgFXm4TI8htWmCyJ6cVPG_A?sub_confirmation=1\n\nCheck out our latest videos playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsHnS3mZglg&list=PL5gq3QGk5j3hRwpMNKQ9L5NyUt3FiTmSy",

She can't reach the kite, but luckily, a monkey firefighter springs into action, climbing the tree and retrieving the kite for Uncle Roy!\n\nMeanwhile, Charlotte is policing the town in her blue car. She spots bad guy Jim, who's been driving carelessly and littering. Charlotte does her duty, pulling him over and issuing a ticket. Good job, Charlotte!\n\nAlex is busy too, driving his green garbage truck. He's using the truck's grabber to pick up trash around town, ensuring it stays clean and beautiful. When Uncle Roy accidentally drops a bottle, Alex reminds him to take care of their town, and together, they clean up.\n\nWe come full circle back to Ellie, as the wheels on the bus go round and round.

Here are some tips for helping kids to eat more healthily:\n\n1. Offer a variety of healthy foods: Children are more likely to eat a variety of healthy foods if they are available. Try to include a range of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and proteins in your child's diet.\n\n2. Make meals and snacks appealing: Presentation is important when it comes to getting kids to try new foods. Try cutting fruits and vegetables into fun shapes or serving them with dips or sauces.\n\n3. Set a good example: Children are more likely to eat healthy foods if they see their parents and other adults eating them as well. Be a good role model by eating a variety of healthy foods yourself.\n\n4. Involve kids in meal planning and preparation: Children are more likely to eat foods that they have helped to prepare. Involve them in planning and cooking meals and snacks.\n\n5. Offer healthy options at snack time: Instead of sugary snacks, try offering fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds as healthier alternatives.\n\n6. Limit sugary drinks: Instead of soda, offer water, milk, or 100% fruit juice as healthier beverage options.\n\n7. Don't make a big deal out of unhealthy foods: If you don't want your child to eat too many unhealthy foods, try not to make a big deal out of them. Children may be more likely to want unhealthy foods if they feel like they are being restricted.\nSubscribe for notifications to new videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgFXm4TI8htWmCyJ6cVPG_A?sub_confirmation=1\n\nCheck out our latest videos playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsHnS3mZglg&list=PL5gq3QGk5j3hRwpMNKQ9L5NyUt3FiTmSy\n\nDownload the Toys and Colors App: \nhttps://mobile.toysandcolors.com/youtube",
