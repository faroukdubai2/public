Don't worry, everyone starts somewhere, in this super compilation we see all five members of The Squirrel Club - Norrie, Roly, Happy, Tag and Betty on their first days with Duggee. You can watch full episodes of Hey Duggee on BBC iPlayer. \n\n00:00 - Norrie's First Day\n\nSeries 4, Episode 1 - Norrie skips into the Clubhouse and greets her friends. Together, they reflect on their first meeting. \n\nArriving with her parents in a long limousine, Norrie, her parents and her 72 siblings flood out of the car. It's just Norrie who is going to stay at the Clubhouse, though, and enjoy some well-needed quiet. She can play alone and hear herself think! But after a while, she misses the hustle and bustle, so Duggee introduces Norrie to Enid the cat. Together, they venture into the Clubhouse, and Norrie has a friend so she isn't alone, but she still has a little bit more room than she would have at home! \n\n03:00 - Roly's First Day\n\nSeries 4, Episode 3 - As Roly makes his usual noise in the Clubhouse, Duggee and the Squirrels reminisce about how completely different Roly was when he first arrived. Hiding behind his dad, Roly wasn't loud at all but impossibly quiet! \n\nAs Duggee shows Roly around the Clubhouse, he squeals, hides and hangs off his dad, and just seems altogether too shy to fit in. Duggee has a great idea to introduce Roly to Norrie, thinking a friend will help him to settle in. But Roly is still too shy, so Duggee and Norrie start doing things with him, knowing this will help him to embrace the fun of the Clubhouse. While painting, playing with balloons and yelling, Roly begins to truly find his voice and be himself! Soon, Roly hardly noticed if his dad was around at all.\n\n06:07 - Happy's First Day \n\nSeries 4, Episode 5 - Happy has always loved the water - even though it makes a mess! But while swimming around in his paddling pool at the playhouse, Duggee reminds the Squirrels that there was a time when Happy feared water. \n\n09:15 - Tag's First Day \n\nSeries 4, Episode 7 - The Squirrels are crafting in the Clubhouse when Betty saves Tag from throwing water across the table instead of glitter. We learn quickly that Tag, although full of enthusiasm and energy, has not always been the best listener. He was great at discovering new things, and everyone wanted to join in with him - but getting easily distracted would land him in an array of trouble. \n\n12:20 - Betty's First Day\n\nSeries 4, Episode 9 - The Squirrels are having fun playing games but are surprised to find out that Betty didn’t always enjoy playing. \n\nSince her first day at Squirrel Club, she always impressed everyone with her confidence and independence, but at first she didn’t know how to join in with the others. Luckily, Duggee had a great idea to bring all the Squirrels together.\n\nCBeebies is dedicated to delighting and surprising its pre-school audience and it remains the UK's most watched and most loved channel for the under-sixes. \n\nCBeebies is dedicated to delighting and surprising its pre-school audience and it remains the UK's most watched and most loved channel for the under-sixes. \n\n#CBeebies #heyduggee #backtoschool #squirrelclub",

All morning, he keeps thinking that people are asking him “Can bears ski?” – it’s confusing. Why would they keep asking that?\n\nWhen he gets to school, Little Bear doesn’t quite follow what his friend has said at lunch that everyone else finds so funny, and he’s not sure what Teacher Bear asks him either.\n\nAfter school, Dad picks the Little Bear up and they go and see an audiologist who does some tests, and fits Little Bear with some hearing aids. Suddenly the world is very loud indeed! Perhaps people haven’t been asking him “Can bears ski?” after all – perhaps it was “Can you hear me?” And when Dad reads a bedtime story, Little Bear can finally appreciate what he was missing before.\n\nCBeebies is dedicated to delighting and surprising its pre-school audience and it remains the UK's most watched and most loved channel for the under-sixes. \n\n#CBeebies #BedtimeStories #Strictly #RoseAylingEllis #BSL #ReadAlong",
