The Squirrels prepare for the climb to rescue Enid, but first Duggee teaches them what they need to pack in their backpacks for a successful trip. \n\nThe team walk through rocky terrain, grey skies, plentiful rain and snow blizzards but keep morale high as they learn how phrasing negative thoughts into helpful ones will let them overcome any challenges along the way. The Squirrels repeat their positive affirmations to keep climbing up the Sugar Bun as a team, and when they find themselves at the top of the mountain, they all give Enid a big hug. A successful rescue mission means Happy can have his nap on the sofa with Enid when they are back!

Don't worry, everyone starts somewhere, in this super compilation we see all five members of The Squirrel Club - Norrie, Roly, Happy, Tag and Betty on their first days with Duggee. You can watch full episodes of Hey Duggee on BBC iPlayer. \n\n00:00 - Norrie's First Day\n\nSeries 4, Episode 1 - Norrie skips into the Clubhouse and greets her friends. Together, they reflect on their first meeting. \n\nArriving with her parents in a long limousine, Norrie, her parents and her 72 siblings flood out of the car. It's just Norrie who is going to stay at the Clubhouse, though, and enjoy some well-needed quiet. She can play alone and hear herself think! But after a while, she misses the hustle and bustle, so Duggee introduces Norrie to Enid the cat. Together, they venture into the Clubhouse, and Norrie has a friend so she isn't alone, but she still has a little bit more room than she would have at home! \n\n03:00 - Roly's First Day\n\nSeries 4, Episode 3 - As Roly makes his usual noise in the Clubhouse, Duggee and the Squirrels reminisce about how completely different Roly was when he first arrived. Hiding behind his dad, Roly wasn't loud at all but impossibly quiet! \n\nAs Duggee shows Roly around the Clubhouse, he squeals, hides and hangs off his dad, and just seems altogether too shy to fit in. Duggee has a great idea to introduce Roly to Norrie, thinking a friend will help him to settle in. But Roly is still too shy, so Duggee and Norrie start doing things with him, knowing this will help him to embrace the fun of the Clubhouse. While painting, playing with balloons and yelling, Roly begins to truly find his voice and be himself! Soon, Roly hardly noticed if his dad was around at all.\n\n06:07 - Happy's First Day \n\nSeries 4, Episode 5 - Happy has always loved the water - even though it makes a mess! But while swimming around in his paddling pool at the playhouse, Duggee reminds the Squirrels that there was a time when Happy feared water. \n\n09:15 - Tag's First Day \n\nSeries 4, Episode 7 - The Squirrels are crafting in the Clubhouse when Betty saves Tag from throwing water across the table instead of glitter. We learn quickly that Tag, although full of enthusiasm and energy, has not always been the best listener. He was great at discovering new things, and everyone wanted to join in with him - but getting easily distracted would land him in an array of trouble. \n\n12:20 - Betty's First Day\n\nSeries 4, Episode 9 - The Squirrels are having fun playing games but are surprised to find out that Betty didn‚Äôt always enjoy playing. \n\nSince her first day at Squirrel Club, she always impressed everyone with her confidence and independence, but at first she didn‚Äôt know how to join in with the others.

Somehow, they seem to have a terrible power over Dave, and make him jump all over some nearby campers‚Äô tents, as well as eating all their food.\n\nYet, Dave‚Äôs antics aren‚Äôt enough for the Eyebrows of Doom, and they jump onto Ron the seagull, making him poop all over some nearby holidaymakers ‚Äì and persuade a sweet little girl to stuff her ice cream down the back of her grampa‚Äôs trousers. Enough is enough! Who will be able to defeat the Eyebrows of Doom? And will their efforts be enough?\n\nWritten by Steve Smallman\nIllustrated by Miguel Ordonez\n\nCBeebies is dedicated to delighting and surprising its pre-school audience and it remains the UK's most watched and most loved channel for the under-sixes. \n\n#CBeebies #BedtimeStories #SteveCarell #BBCiPlayer",
