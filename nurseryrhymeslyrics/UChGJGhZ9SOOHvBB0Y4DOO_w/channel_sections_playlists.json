Together they will create a chemical Reaction that will blow up the Ballon!!! Just be careful don't use too much as it may pop the balloon or goes into the balloons like we did! =) \n\nJust add some Vinegar an empty water bottle. Then add some baking soda (you don't need very much, just one or two tablespoon will do) to the ballon. Then attached the ballon to the top of the bottle. Lift up the balloon so the Baking Soda will fall down and mix with the Vinegar.  A chemical reaction will take place with carbon dioxide bubbles which will rise and  inflate the balloon!!!!",
