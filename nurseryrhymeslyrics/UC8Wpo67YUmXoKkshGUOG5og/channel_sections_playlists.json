          "description": "Even in a prosperous country like Canada, there are still many at-risk communities with children and families living in impoverished conditions. That is why in May 2018, The Toy Movement partnered with two minor hockey organizations, The Mimico Canadiens and the Rankin Inlet Minor Hockey Association, to bring toys to kids in Canada‚Äôs far north. Hundreds of underprivileged children in the remote Inuit community of Rankin Inlet, Nunavut were surprised to receive new toys donated by Spin Master and handed out door-to-door by the young hockey players.\n\nThe players from Mimico were visiting the northern community at the edge of the Arctic Circle as part of an Experiences Canada cultural exchange program to promote minor hockey ties among the communities. When the team heard about what Spin Master was doing with the Toy Movement, they met, and an opportunity was identified to assist each other in spreading goodwill to the north.\n\nSpin Master arranged a donation of hundreds of toys and sent personnel to accompany the mission to assist and see firsthand the joy they brought to the children. Like many northern towns, Rankin Inlet is a proud, culturally rich community but it faces the challenges of poverty, home security and an astronomically high cost of living, making even basic toys an unattainable luxury for many. The Mimico and Rankin hockey organizations along with volunteers from the Rankin community orchestrated the donation of shipping from MGA International and Calm Air and the wrapping and distribution of the toys making it a real team effort. Even the RCMP scored an assist when they helped to distribute toys to other far off hamlets by plane and snowmobile.\n\nThe players wrapped the gifts and then went door-to-door to deliver the toys to those households most in need. It was a truly heartwarming sight for many seeing kids giving back to kids. In the end it was hard to tell who had the bigger smiles, the children who received the toys or the young hockey players who felt the joy of the spirit of giving. Unlike in a hockey game, this time everyone got to win.\n\nThe Toy Movement aims to deliver inspiration, imagination, and joy to children in desperate need all over the world.\n\nTo find more exciting Spin Master games and toys visit our website: http://www.spinmaster.com \n\nJoin the conversation and share your photos with us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/spinmaster\n\nWe Tweet too!!

          "description": "On December 15th, the ORPHANetwork (ONET) and the Toy Movement brought the gift of play to 13,000 children living in impoverished areas across Nicaragua. A five-person team from Spin Master joined forces with ONET to distribute toys, just in time for Christmas.\n\nWorking with a network of Local Church Initiatives (LCIs) - which currently support 23,000 kids throughout Nicaragua - the team was able to address gifts to each child by name. For many children, this was the first time they had received a present. The moment was made even more special when children saw their name handwritten on their giftwrapped toy.\n\nOver the course of four days, the team was able to visit LCIs in several regions of Nicaragua, including the country's capital, Managua, and the mounts of rural Matagalpa.\n\nBehind the scenes, 135 volunteers individually wrapped 13,000 toys in less than one day. Due to the incredible partnerships, selfless volunteers, and donated toys, thousands of children began the holiday season with big smiles.\n\nThe Toy Movement aims to distribute more than 500,000 toys to 500,000 children in 2018, delivering inspiration, imagination, and joy to children in troubled parts of the world.\n\nTo find more exciting Spin Master games and toys visit our website: http://www.spinmaster.com \n\nJoin the conversation and share your photos with us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/spinmaster\n\nWe Tweet too!!

This partnership ensured toys were safely and successfully distributed to children at each of the camps.\n\nAfter personally overseeing another successful Toy Movement mission, Ronnen Harary (Co-Founder of the Toy Movement, Co-CEO, and Co-Founder of Spin Master Ltd.) was delighted to touch on what makes this movement so special.\n\n\"The Toy Movement is about so much more than simply giving children toys. Regardless of their circumstances, children deserve the opportunity to grow, play and learn, and to know that they are not forgotten. Discovering a toy makes this possible, and despite the difficult circumstances these children find themselves in, we are committed to finding a way to reach kids no matter where they live.\"\n\nThis February's mission to Iraq marks the 6th successful Toy Movement partnership, helping to ensure that kids all over the world have the opportunity to play.\n\nTo find more exciting Spin Master games and toys visit our website: http://www.spinmaster.com \n\nJoin the conversation and share your photos with us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/spinmastagram\n\nWe Tweet too!!

Kids are the future and every little thing that we can do to help them smile and bring them happiness matters,‚Äù said Ben Gadbois. ‚ÄúThe team at Tecma have been instrumental in bringing the missions in Mexico to fruition.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe values demonstrated by Spin Master‚Äôs The Toy Movement initiative align with those of the Tecma Group,‚Äù added Toby Spoon, Tecma‚Äôs Executive Vice President. ‚ÄúThe Toy Movement initiative underscores what is important to our company and our partners. It illustrates our ideals in action.‚Äù\n\nSpin Master and Tecma will be contacting supportive businesses in El Paso and Juarez who would like to participate in the movement.
