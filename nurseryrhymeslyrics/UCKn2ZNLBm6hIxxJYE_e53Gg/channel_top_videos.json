He’s known to make all kinds of homemade inventions from whatever random objects he can get his mitts on, and he’s keen to use his problem-solving skills to help friends out of a sticky situation. Jack considers himself a carrot connoisseur, often found munching and crunching while he’s sketching out blueprints or reading up on the latest discoveries in science and engineering. And of course, he can never resist a good board game or puzzle – he won’t rest until he’s found the solution! \n\nSubscribe and check out more great videos ➡ https://www.youtube.com/c/SagoMini \n\nPlay now with Piknik ➡ https://playpiknik.com/",

His exceptional hopping skills make leaping over buildings in a single bound look like a breeze! Although he can be anxious, argumentative, and a bit of a scaredy-cat, Jack’s curiosity and endless creativity make life interesting for everyone around him. He’s known to make all kinds of homemade inventions from whatever random objects he can get his mitts on, and he’s keen to use his problem-solving skills to help friends out of a sticky situation. Jack considers himself a carrot connoisseur, often found munching and crunching while he’s sketching out blueprints or reading up on the latest discoveries in science and engineering. And of course, he can never resist a good board game or puzzle – he won’t rest until he’s found the solution! \n\nSubscribe and check out more great videos ➡ https://www.youtube.com/c/SagoMini \n\nPlay now with Piknik ➡ https://playpiknik.com/",
